Eerily, Winehouse predicted that she would join the '27 Club' before her untimely passing.

While her style was certainly inspired by the music of the 1950s and 1960s, she made the sound her own. She was able to modernize it and create chart-topping singles and albums. She was focused on her artistry, and introduced something new to 2000s pop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Deeply invested in her work, Winehouse also struggled immensely with the pressures of fame. As a result, she<strong> began to have a dependence on alcohol and other substances</strong>. Furthermore, Winehouse was well aware of the fates of performers who came before her, according to Grunge.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/prince-offered-to-help-amy-winehouse-escape-from-her-husband-blake-fielder-civil-after-he-stole-from-him.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Prince Offered To Help Amy Winehouse Escape From Her Husband Blake Fielder-Civil</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Prince had some plans to save Winehouse from her troubled marriage.</span><p>She knew she was living a life in the fast lane, similar to that of Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, and Jimi Hendrix. All of these young talents tragically passed away at 27, leading to the '27 Club' distinction in music history. According to Alex Foden, who was a dear friend of Winehouse's,</p><p>"Amy always told me she thought she would die young and that she knew she'd become a part of the 27 Club."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Why Winehouse believed her time was limited can never be known for certain. However, it is safe to assume that she <strong>recognized that her lifestyle could have dire consequences</strong>. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Winehouse would pass away</a>, as she prophesized, at 27 years old on July 23rd, 2011. According to Biography, she passed away due to accidental alcohol poisoning.</p><p>Winehouse was far from the only entertainer to predict their death. Jim Morrison, a fellow member of the '27 Club', also<a href=#> predicted his passing</a>. Jimi Hendrix, another member of the '27 Club', eerily predicted his demise as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/amy-winehouse-at-the-2007-mtv-movie-awards-deposit.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to All Things Interesting, Winehouse was very dependent on alcohol in her final years. Furthermore, she was, at times, so intoxicated that she could not give concerts. Before Winehouse's death, she was taking steps to better her health. She even canceled a planned tour so that she could focus on recovering from her substance abuse.</p><p>Winehouse was laid to rest at Edgwarebury Cemetery near her grandmother in London, England following her passing. Her final resting place remains a place of pilgrimage for fans.</p><h2 id=inside-amy-winehouse-39-s-serious-physical-and-mental-health-issues>Inside Amy Winehouse's Serious Physical And Mental Health Issues</h2><p>Not only did <strong>Amy Winehouse struggle with substance abuse</strong>, but she also faced serious eating challenges. According to Elle, <strong>Winehouse was bulimic</strong>. She reportedly had struggled with the condition since she was a teenager. Allegedly, Winehouse would allow herself to eat anything but then vomit after her meals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/amy-winehouse-sighting.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Winehouse would suffer from bulimia until her passing, and the condition only made her health worse. She also had a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">complicated relationship with her husband</a>, Blake Fielder-Civil, according to Grunge. While they shared an undeniable bond, both struggled with substance abuse. Furthermore, Fielder-Civil got arrested during their marriage after an altercation with a pub operator. Winehouse also cheated on him during their marriage.</p><p>Fielder-Civil reportedly encouraged Winehouse's substance dependence. Following her passing, he shared that "I regret it, not just because of the damage it's caused Amy and the loss of life, but the damage to her family but also to my family and also to me."</p><p>Even though Winehouse was unfaithful, she still felt a strong connection to Fielder-Civil and wanted to maintain their relationship. Fielder-Civil, on the other hand, desired a divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Winehouse, "I still love Blake and I want him to move into my new house with me....I won't let him divorce me. He's the male version of me and we're perfect for each other." Unfortunately for Winehouse, Fielder-Civil was successfully able to file for a divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/amy-winehouse-concert-roxy-theater-2007.jpg><p>According to Grunge, Winehouse had a history with physical violence. She was even arrested for physically attacking multiple individuals while out partying one evening in 2008. In another incident, Winehouse punched a person who wanted to take a picture with her. She was arrested again for her behavior. Winehouse got into legal trouble for physical violence on other occasions as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For such a young talent, Amy Winehouse had a deeply troubled life. Despite her substance challenges and legal issues, Winehouse continued to have a loyal fan base. Many of her songs became hits, including:</p><ul><li><strong>"Rehab"</strong></li><li><strong>"Valerie"</strong></li><li><strong>"You Know I'm No Good"</strong></li><li><strong>"Back to Black"</strong></li></ul><p>When Winehouse passed away, her death was profound around the world. Not only did it impact her family and friends, but her legions of fans. Like many entertainers before her, Winehouse could not handle fame as well as her personal struggles. Even though she passed away over a decade ago, Winehouse remains fondly remembered by the music community and her supporters. Fortunately for her fans, she left a treasured body of work that they can enjoy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYprFdrLavsceorKydXZ2yorjToWSiq6OqsrR5kXBknKSll3qlscCtn2aoopqxqq%2FToqanZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./eric-heiden-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>&#171;&nbsp;Eric Heiden Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a>
