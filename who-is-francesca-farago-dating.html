They included a Toi et Moi cut, a vine detail around the two stones, and small Marquise diamonds to represent Francesca’s grandmother’s ring.</p><p>The ring had a special touch with the inside of the band being engraved with a paw print dedicated to the couple’s pet Pomeranian. Ring Concierge CEO Nicole Wegman played a pivotal role in ensuring the ring design matched Francesca’s vision, and that the final product was a perfect representation of their love. Jesse Sullivan fell in love with the ring, and it serves as a symbol of their journey together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Meet_Jesse_Sullivan></span><strong>Meet Jesse Sullivan</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jesse Sullivan, born in 1989, is a well-known TikTok personality who has gained a substantial following of approximately 2.8 million users on the platform.
