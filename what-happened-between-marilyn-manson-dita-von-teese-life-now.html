Von Teese has shifted her attention to her work and continues to be incredibly successful, with an impressive fan following (over 2.7 million followers on Instagram alone). She has a film, Night of the Teese, and she appeared in Don't Worry Darling and in Taylor Swift's music video "Bejeweled." There is no denying Von Teese is a recognizable figure (some may even argue iconic), and she's in high demand. This includes her Glamonatrix Tour. She feels her work is important, empowering even.</p><p>"I think it's important for women to see examples of other women holding their power, embracing their sensuality at every age. It's not easy to describe or explain how something like striptease can be empowering… you just have to see it," she told Page Six."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/marilyn-manson-and-dita-von-teese.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dita Von Teese has also made something clear; she has no intentions of getting married again (<a href=# rel=nofollow>but she has been in new relationships</a>). "I'm not thinking about [marriage] at all. I had a big obnoxious wedding and an obnoxious divorce and don't feel the need to do it again," she told Hello! Magazine. As for what she gets up to in her spare time:</p><p>"I surround myself with friends who are kind, love animals like I do and have a good sense of humor.

"I was completely destroyed. I had no soul left," he told Spin magazine (via People). "I define myself as a person, a human, an artist, as someone who makes things – writing, painting, music – and I couldn't do anything."</p><p>"It's the old cliche," he said. "Marriage changes everything." His comments suggest that he and Von Teese wanted very different things in their relationship.</p><p>"I realized that what's wrong about me is right. To play devil's advocate – but that doesn't really work, since I'm the devil – people would say that drugs and alcohol wrecked my marriage," Manson explained.</p><p>"But buyer beware, she said she had tolerated the lifestyle because she hoped I would change and threatened to leave if I didn't. I was sleeping on the couch in my own home. I was no longer supposed to be a rock star. I was someone who had to be apologized for. I wasn't prepared to be alone. I came out of this naked, a featherless bird."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmpZGntq3FzWakmqajpLtusMitmGaun6N6tbHErJxmpJmbsm66zrBm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./joseline-hernandez-law-enforcement-arrest.html>&#171;&nbsp;Joseline Hernandez Jokes About Arrest Warrant For Alleged Battery</a>
