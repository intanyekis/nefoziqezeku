We feel fresh. We feel fierce. We feel…a little nervous we’re going to chip our nails.</span></p><p>It’s true, manicures are the best. But professional manicures aren’t foolproof. Ever walk out of the salon feeling amazing, and then get home and realize your nails are chipped? We’ve all been there before.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>When you spend an hour at a nail salon, you want to feel confident that manicure is going to last for at least a week — anything less feels like a total rip-off.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Recently, we’ve been inspired by all the incredible nail artists on Instagram and TikTok. The things people can do with some nail polish and a finely pointed brush are insane! It actually has&nbsp;<i>Us</i> thinking…could we do something like that? Okay, maybe not all the fancy artwork — but maybe, just maybe, we could get a salon-quality manicure at home.</span></p><p>And that, my friends, is how we discovered Nailboo.</p><p>Nailboo is an awesome at-home nail brand that gives you everything you need for a perfect manicure and it <i>actually works.</i> Nailboo is so easy to use, and we can’t recommend it enough. With 60+ colors available, it has all of the benefits of getting a manicure without any of the drawbacks.</p><p><a href=#><span class=s2>Learn more about Nailboo on their website</span></a>, or keep reading here for the full scoop.</p><p class=p2><strong><span class=s1>Easy To Use Nail Kits</span></strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>We’d seen a lot of videos of people using dip powder to paint their nails, but we always figured it was too good to be true. That’s not the case when it comes to Nailboo!</span></p><p>Their dip kit includes everything you need for a fab set of nails. Inside, you’ll find:</p><ul class=ul1><li class=li3><b></b><span class=s1><b>A build powder</b>: An extra step between prep and activation.</span></li><li class=li3><b></b><span class=s1><b>Colored powders</b>: You can choose your faves from their selection of 60+ colors.</span></li><li class=li3><b></b><span class=s1><b>Liquid essentials and cleaner</b>: All the ingredients you need to prep and activate Nailboo’s dip powder.&nbsp;</span></li><li class=li3><b></b><span class=s1><b>Accessories</b>: A nail file, brush and cuticle pusher, same as you would get from the nail salon.&nbsp;</span></li><li class=li3><b></b><span class=s1><b>Remover clips:</b> Durable clips that make removing Nailboo’s powder a breeze.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p class=p1><span class=s1>You might not be a dip-color expert yet, but trust <i>Us</i> — that dip kit is a steal for what you’re getting. Each of these items helps you get that shiny, chip-free manicure that lasts at a fraction of the cost of a trip to the nail salon.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2><strong><span class=s1>Quick-Drying Dip Powders</span></strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Another reason to love Nailboo is that it seriously cuts down on the time you spend getting a manicure. Their manicure set is quick-drying and done in minutes!</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>After you dip your nails into your desired color, you apply a liquid activation coat that hardens the powder, seals in the color and gives you dry nails in seconds.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Yup, that means you can get back all the time you’d spend waiting around at a drying station or under a UV lamp! You’re welcome.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2><strong><span class=s1>Salon Quality, Every Time</span></strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>There are a number of dip nail kit brands, but we’ve never encountered one that provides such great results every single time.</span></p><p>Within minutes, you get an even, shiny,and perfect set of nails — save an hour at the salon with this Nailboo kit.</p><p>Don’t believe <i>Us?</i> Check out their reviews! There’s plenty of flawless manicures and five-star ratings, including from first-time users.

Their products radically reimagine the at-home manicure experience — making it simple, easy and,&nbsp; most importantly, quick.</span></p><p>Wondering why they started Nailboo? The brand says, “We were tired of having to choose between expensive and time-consuming visits to the nail salon or cheap polishes from the drugstore. Our goal was to create something that created salon-like nails without breaking the bank leaving your home.”</p><p>Now that’s an idea we can all get behind!</p><p class=p2><strong><span class=s1>The Perfect At-Home Experience</span></strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Getting a flawless manicure at home is easier than you think with Nailboo.</span></p><p>Are you new to the dip manicure method? It’s a pretty straightforward process, but we’ll outline it below so you can get a sense of how it works</p><li class=li3><b></b><span class=s1><b>Coat and Build</b>: Apply the base liquid. Dip the nail into the build powder — that’s what gives the colored powder a solid foundation. Remove excess build powder by tapping and brushing.&nbsp;</span></li><li class=li3><b></b><span class=s1><b>Base Coat and Color: </b>Apply base liquid again, one nail at a time. Dip the nail into the colored powder — this is where the magic happens. Remove excess colored powder, same as you did with the build powder.</span></li><li class=li3><b></b><span class=s1><b>Activate: </b>Apply a thin layer (the thinner, the better!) of activator liquid to your nails. Wait two minutes. Buff the tops and edges of your nails with the four-way nail file that comes in your dip kit. Apply a second thin layer of activator liquid.&nbsp;</span></li><li class=li3><b></b><span class=s1><b>Shine:</b> Wait two minutes, then add topcoat for some shine!&nbsp;</span></li><p class=p1><span class=s1>Voilá! Ten perfect nails, done in minutes and almost impossible to mess up.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2><strong><span class=s1>Finally, Manicures That Last!</span></strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Like we said before, there’s nothing worse than getting home from the salon and realizing a nail is already chipped.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Chips are also a danger when it comes to at-home manicures. Before Nailboo, we could never get a hard, secure manicure. There would always be chipping, pooling or smudging.</span></p><p>Well, you can say goodbye to all of that now! Nailboo’s manicures last <i>weeks. </i>Their topcoat and dip formula are seriously magic. No chips, no smudging. Just a perfect layer of long-lasting color every time.</p><p class=p2><strong><span class=s1>Colors on Colors on Colors</span></strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Speaking of color, we’re obsessed with Nailboo’s selection!</span></p><p>They’ve got it all. Glitter, matte, solid, translucent — you name it. We got a few neutrals and a few fun colors in our first dip kit, so we can mix it up based on how we’re feeling. It’s also so easy to do a different color on each nail if you’re feeling a little adventurous.</p><p><a href=#><span class=s2>Explore all of Nailboo’s massive colored powder selection on their website here</span></a>.</p><p class=p2><strong><span class=s1>Become a Nail Art Expert</span></strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>We’ve never claimed to be nail artists but after a few rounds of Nailboo, we’re starting to think we’ve got a future in this. Okay, maybe just for ourselves and our friends, but you get the point!</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>You don’t need to go to the salon to get a perfect manicure. We promise. You can do it!</span></p><p class=p2><strong><span class=s1>Nail Care Is Self-Care</span></strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>With Nailboo, we look forward to doing our nails. It’s not a chore — it’s a fun way to express yourself without breaking the bank.</span></p><p>In addition to their dip kits, Nailboo also sells hand and feet treatments so you can recreate the salon experience without ever leaving your house. We’re obsessed!</p><p>Their Spa Collection includes their fan-favorite treatments (Dream Hands, Dream Feet, and Cuticle Milk), which leave your hands and feet looking moisturized, healthy and professionally cared for. Don’t worry, we won’t tell anyone you did it yourself.</p><p class=p2><strong><span class=s1>Nailboo Has All the Tricks</span></strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>If you’re looking to level up your nail art game, you can also check out all the tutorials on Nailboo’s website.</span></p><p>They’ve got everything you need there. You can get step-by-step instructions on basic dip use, including how to apply their powders and remove them using their nail clips.

You can purchase the starter kit (one color), essentials kit (four colors), or their pro kit (six colors), which is also their best value.</p><p>No matter what you decide, we know you’re going to love it.
