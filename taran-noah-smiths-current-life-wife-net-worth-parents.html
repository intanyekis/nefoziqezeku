Smith ventured into other pursuits for a living after selling his residence in California and moving out.</p><p>While the majority of his post-show revenues came from the short-lived vegan cheese business, the former child star also established a “floating art museum,” became a charter sailboat skipper, and is currently reportedly teaching people to pilot submarines.</p><p>His net worth is presently estimated to be <strong>USD 300,000</strong>. That is a rather astounding sum for someone who vanished from the performing industry following his first commercial triumph.</p><h2><span id=Taran_Noah_Smith_and_his_Spouse>Taran Noah Smith and his Spouse</span></h2><p>On<strong> April 27, 2001</strong>, the American actor married Heidi van Pelt. His first marriage, on the other hand, drew a lot of attention due to the couple’s age difference. Taran was 17 when he married, and his ex-wife was 36.</p><p>Unfortunately, the couple’s contentious marriage did not endure long, and they divorced after seven years. Even though the couple had no children together, the public details of their brief marriage are full of startling twists such as claims of open marriage, jealous wife, and legal problems.</p><p>Taran Smith told The Inquirer, as published by allwomenstalk.com, about his former wife: Heidi informed me that she liked ladies to boys.<br>She started bringing girlfriends home. She’d be envious if they paid more attention to me than to her.</p><p>He continued, “Finally, we decided on an open marriage. But when I started seeing another female, Heidi became so enraged that she destroyed every dish in the home.”</p><p>Taran and his wife’s court disputes were largely about ownership of a business they created together, a vegan cashew cheese-making enterprise.</p><p>Taran’s whirlwind romance with his last marriage, which began when he was a minor, ruined a lot, most notably his tranquility following the end of his show and his relationship with his parents.</p><h2><span id=What_Became_of_Smith8217s_Parents>What Became of Smith’s Parents?</span></h2><p>The ‘Home Improvement’ actor, who was born to father David Smith and mother Candy Bennici, already had a strained relationship with his parents when he eloped.</p><p>Money was the true reason for his strained connection with his father and mother. Shortly after fleeing with his ex-girlfriend, the actor accused his parents of wasting his money while he was still on the show.</p><p>His proceeds from the program were all put into a trust fund, but Taran was taken aback by his father and mother’s criticism. All of this came to an end when Smith finalized his formal separation, reclaimed his business, and reconciled with his parents.</p><p>Smith apologized and denied all of their claims. He also stated that they had been correct about Heidi all along. Taran Noah, according to The Inquirer, stated, “I had to go back to them and apologize.</p><p>Heidi, you were correct.'”</p><p>Taran addressed the problem when they reached an agreement. “I’d gotten out of the teenage phase and understood my parents weren’t doing anything wrong but were attempting to protect me,” he told Independent Journal.</p><p>Taran spent his entire youth on ‘Home Improvement,’ not just a year or two. All of the money he earned during those years was placed in a trust fund that Smith would have access to once he reached the age of eighteen.</p><p>Taran was already a billionaire by the age of eighteen, thanks to the successful sitcom and a few other films, which marked the pinnacle of his fame in the show business.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
