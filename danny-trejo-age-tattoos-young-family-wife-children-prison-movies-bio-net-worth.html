Till date, he played roles of a criminal, prisoner, boxer or something similar and no other can carry those so well as Danny Trejo does.</p><p>Danny stands with 5 feet 5 inches tall height and a well maintained, muscular body and yes, those interesting tattoos. In most of his movies, we can see his tattoos. In fact, he has seven tattoos altogether. His signature tattoo is the one on his chest.</p><p><strong>Recommended:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Katie Goodland Wiki: Dating, Boyfriend, Married, Kids, Bio, Age, Job, Birthday</a></strong></p><p>He inked it when he was in prison. Likewise, he inked a woman wearing a Sombrero. The tattoo covers maximum part of his torso from his&nbsp;chest. Moreover, he also tattooed his ex-wife Debbie’s name and his daughter’s name <strong>Danielle</strong>.</p><p>Furthermore, he also tattooed a peacock, hummingbird, rose and a Catholic cross. As a matter of fact, he is a perfect example of “rags to the richest.”</p><p>Before appearing in the movies, Danny worked as a labor foreman in construction. His childhood was difficult as well. Look at him now. He is a recognized figure in Hollywood and also owns a restaurant named “Trejo’s Tacos” in Los Angeles, USA.
