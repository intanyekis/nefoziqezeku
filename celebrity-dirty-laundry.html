It also went on to say Sam still has lingering feelings for Drew so I don’t know what’s going to happen there because Drew is moving on with Carly. Is Celebrity Dirty Laundry a reliable source? It was also mentioned that Lulu can’t wake up until Genie Francis is back on canvas, does anyone know when she’s coming back?</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>I think I read something on this website about it being time for Lulu to wake up. I remember it mentioned that Lulu and Dante were no longer together. I thought before she collapsed that declared their undying love for each other. I remember an upcoming spoiler saying something about Drew and Sam talking about their relationship. I can’t remember if that is how it was worded. I am sure they will want to talk about Scout. That poor child should decide to give herself another name. While she is at it, I hope she will change Rocco and Wiley’s names.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>I’ve said from the beginning Scout is an awful name, they should call her by her real name… Emily. Scout sounds like a dirty little girl with boogers in her nose! Aside from that I remember Lulu did say she loved Dante before she fell into her coma, I don’t remember him saying it back or if he even heard her say that, but even if he had those feelings now he seems to be really into Sam but who knows? We will see. But if Drew still has feelings for Sam that means Carly will be left in the lurch unless they bring on somebody for her. I really hope we can see one happy couple soon.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>I don’t think CDL is the most reliable site. Lots of things on there have never happened. I do think it’s time for Lulu to wake up though. Get her and Dante back together and Sam and Drew together. Get rid of Austin and bring back RoHo as Todd for Carly. Maxie needs to take a break from men or get back with Spinelli. He and Nathan were the only men good for her.</p><p><span class=post-likes>6 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>qbee</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>September 9, 2022, 3:53pm <span itemprop=position>5</span></span><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>mittie</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>September 9, 2022, 5:46pm <span itemprop=position>6</span></span><p>YES!!

I always say they are just begging for someone to bully their child because of the name.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>Kim Kardashian’s kids have unusual names, her sisters too… A lot of celebrities nowadays are doing it. I personally don’t know anyone in my circle but I would imagine alot of non celebrities are picking some strange names as well.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>I don’t know who this Kim person is. I think the children are the ones who suffer. My uncle’s grandson and his wife were expecting a girl about 4 years ago. I called to ask if the baby had been born. No, but I was told the name that was chosen. Adaline Grace. I thought Adaline sounded so old fashioned. I was given the credit or blame as it was for the name. I had sent him some family history I had dug up. His grandmother told me, that he had picked the name out of some of the things I had sent. I like the name Grace better. They have a 1-year-old boy, and he was given an old-fashioned sounding name too. I was asked if there was anyone in the family with that name. Turns out I found 2 men with that name. I had not shared that information. Another cousin has grandchildren with names that when I heard, I instantly thought that is a name for an old man.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>Kim Kardashian? The Kardashians? Kim Kardashian and Kanye West who named their kids all those crazy names? I don’t watch the show Keeping Up with the Kardashians as I hate reality shows,but they’ve all been on the news forever whether we want to hear about them or not, the weird names they named their kids and I was just using her as an example. Adaline Grace is a very pretty name, but you are right that it is old-fashioned, but at school she will probably be called “Addy” or something like that. A lot of times keeping family names generation after generation is not doing anyone any favors!</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>It’s classic soap opera writing…Lulu goes off the canvas, Dante is finally ready to commit to someone else, so naturally, Lulu is going to be back in the picture.</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><p>I guess someone else liked “To Kill A Mockingbird” besides Bruce & Demi.

Not 100% of their spoilers, but a lot of them. I knew (because its typical soap opera writing) that as soon as Sam and Dante moved in together, Lulu would wake up.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>But what might be portrayed different for a change, Dante’s feelings for Sam will override his past with Lulu. At least they are divorced. Dante is not obligated to go back with her no matter how she feels about him, that’s life, sometimes we get knocked down and don’t always get the person we want to be with.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>mlj2020</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>September 10, 2022, 4:48pm <span itemprop=position>17</span></span><p>IMO Dante and Lulu will absolutely get back together. Dante and Lulu didn’t break up because they no longer loved each other. They broke up because Dante was struggling mentally. He loved Lulu so much that he set her free. She tried to move on but the second Dante was back you could see the pull between the 2. In the end Dante will always love Lulu. He will go back to her out of love not obligation.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>I know what you’re saying but I just don’t see all the love he has for Sam just washing down the drain the minute Lulu wakes up, he’s going to be very conflicted.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>But Sam might feel that Lulu’s return will re-ignite his love for her, whether it is true or not. Lulu’s return will disrupt Sam and Dante’s relationship in one way or another.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>sjogirl</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>September 10, 2022, 7:06pm <span itemprop=position>20</span></span><p>I love it too!
