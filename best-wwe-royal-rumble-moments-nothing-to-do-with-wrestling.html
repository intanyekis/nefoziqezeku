The next year there was a silly posedown between Ravishing Rick Rude and The Ultimate Warrior. Even better were some of the ridiculous quick promos over the years about how such-and-such wrestler was going to win the match.

It took Yoko and about 857 heels to defeat The Phenom, but they did, and The Undertaker was shoved in a box and carted to the locker room.

The Ultimate Warrior, then-WWE Champion was called out to the interview stage by the vivacious Sensational Queen Sherri. She dropped all of her “Scary Sherri” veneer and turned on the sultriness. It was all in the name of trying to convince the nincompoop to give a title shot to her man, The Macho Man, should Warrior defeat Sgt. Slaughter. If you don’t remember Warrior’s answer, but remember The Macho King cracking Warrior with his scepter, then you know full well how Warrior answered Sherri’s proposition.</p><h2 id=owen-kicks-bret-rsquo-s-leg-out-of-his-leg><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Owen Kicks Bret’s Leg Out Of His Leg</span></h2><h3 id=bret-was-far-too-selfish-to-tag-owen-in>Bret Was Far Too Selfish To Tag Owen In</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><ul><li><strong>Re-watch this match.

The Rocket got fed up with his brother hogging the spotlight, even after being horrendously injured to the point that The Harts had to forfeit their tag title match against The Quebecers. He then berated Bret for a few moments before kicking The Hitman in his bum leg.
