Mishawaka’s defensive alignment sent multiple defenders in that direction, with a single-high safety in the middle of the field. Out left, Rice saw one-on-one coverage for his X receiver.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The left-handed passer took the snap and executed a play-action fake with his running back. Then came a glance right, hoping the safety would hedge that way. He did, and when Rice swung his head left toward his intended target with blazing speed, he knew Cathedral had a touchdown.</p><p><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Terry McLaurin</a> would do the rest.</p><p>“He made it happen,” Rice said. “He got separation. Untouched. He made a big play.”</p><p>Rice had heard of McLaurin’s gifts before the receiver arrived for his freshman season. A growth spurt would come later.</p><p>Head coach Rick Streiff doubled as a geography teacher and recalled a freshman McLaurin in his class. “He was a little bitty dude,” Streiff <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">told The Indianapolis Star</a> after McLaurin was named Indiana’s “Mr. Football” in 2013.</p><p>Rice noticed the “smallish” receiver attacking the weight room that first year and “grow exponentially” during his sophomore campaign. That season, Rice’s imagination soared. The backup in 2011, Rice anticipated starting the following year. Watching from the sideline, he saw the receiving brilliance unfold, particularly when McLaurin dazzled during a 2011 playoff game.</p><p>“Throwing to him, that’s going to be exciting,” Rice recalled thinking during a phone call with The Athletic.</p><p>One year later, Rice’s vision came true.</p><p>McLaurin took off running straight for the first 5 yards of the route. With the cornerback peeking back at Rice, McLaurin briefly veered toward the sideline and then zoomed upfield. Like many future Big Ten and NFL defensive backs, the Mishawaka player had no shot to keep up.</p><p>Rice fired deep. McLaurin, now 4 yards ahead of the cornerback, slowed briefly to make the catch and then resumed his blistering sprint for a 79-yard touchdown. The pass<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> remains the longest for a touchdown in Class 4A state championship history</a> and was the catalyst in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the 56-29 romp</a>.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“That’s probably my most memorable Terry play that year,” Rice said. “It set the tone, and we went on to win the game.”</p><p>The wins continued for McLaurin inside Lucas Oil Stadium.</p><p>Cathedral repeated as state champions the following year despite moving to Class 5A. McLaurin, en route to “Mr. Football” honors, scored three touchdowns and had an interception with four tackles in the 2013 title game. He would later win the Big Ten Championship game twice on that field while with Ohio State.</p><p>Even before those high school and college games, he often watched Colts games from Section 540 with his dad, Terry Sr. His parents had season tickets, which meant plenty of games watching Peyton Manning and McLaurin’s football hero, wide receiver Marvin Harrison.</p><p>The Indianapolis native hopes the winning for his side continues this Sunday. McLaurin will make his first hometown appearance as an NFL player as the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Washington Commanders</a> (3-4) face the Colts (3-3-1).</p><p>“I try to do a good job of focusing on what’s important,” McLaurin said following Wednesday’s practice. “Winning this game is the most important thing. But I’d be lying if I said it’s not kind of cool to be able to go back to where I grew up, where my affinity for football started.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Since this is Terry McLaurin nostalgia week, here are some clips from Indiana's 2013 "Mr. Football." Indianapolis Cathedral put a hurting on the BD Saints.<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7hPcPKNM3D</a></p><p>— Ben Standig (@BenStandig) <a href=#>October 27, 2022</a></p><p>The hype for his future career exploded in the 2012 title game. McLaurin set another still-standing record with a 66-yard punt return and later found the end zone a second time with a 41-yard touchdown run. He finished the season with 953 yards and eight touchdowns on 58 receptions.</p><p>“His speed is something that sets us apart as a team,” Streiff said <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">after the 2012 championship game</a>. “He’s a real difference-maker.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Rice, who went on to start at quarterback for Wabash College, said he never contemplated the possibility that any of his teammates would play professional football, adding, “We were just so focused on winning games.”</p><p>Basketball is the dominant prep sport in the Hoosier state, but high school football is hardly an afterthought, especially at powerhouse Cathedral. Alums include former <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Dolphins</a> wide receiver Mark Clayton and Saints linebacker <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Pete Werner</a>.</p><p>“It’s taken very seriously,” Rice said. “Not only by players but students and parents. Cathedral football is a big, big deal.”</p><p>McLaurin’s advanced maturity — “mature” is the perfect word for him,” Rice said — fit perfectly with the program, though he let his lighter side shine through.</p><p>“There were moments where we’re joking or (having fun) on the team bus or in the locker room,” Rice said. “Terry’s no square at all.”</p><p>McLaurin was becoming the team’s star. Yet despite his burgeoning BMOC status, Rice could not recall an ego-driven moment from his top target.</p><p>“He was willing to share opportunities among teammates,” Rice said. “Whether it was leaning into the running game or (targeting) other receivers one week, this was a very unselfish guy, a great teammate, and competitive.</p><p>“If I threw a pick or something bad happened, he was there with great energy, wanted to (help you) improve and the team to get better. Always had a great attitude. … A good teammate and made big plays for us.”</p><p>Some things never change.</p><p>“He’s a professional,” Washington quarterback <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Taylor Heinicke</a> said Wednesday. “You never hear anything bad about him. There’s not one guy on the team that can say anything bad about him. … He’s awesome. He’s a great friend, teammate and someone you don’t want to let down.”</p><p>Asked why he targets McLaurin often, Heinicke kept it simple. “He’s our best receiver,” he said.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Heinicke’s faith in McLaurin paid off multiple times in Washington’s 23-21 victory over <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Green Bay</a> on Sunday. The two connected for a 37-yard touchdown pass in the second half that ranked as the most “improbable reception” (19.8 percent) during Week 7, according to Next Gen Stats. It marked his 11th career reception with a completion probability under 25 percent, which is tied for most in the NFL since 2019 with the Chargers’ <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Mike Williams</a>.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>It is spooky szn after all 👻</p><p>📺 <a href=#>#GBvsWAS</a> FOX <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gJHElJxRn1</a></p><p>— Washington Commanders (@Commanders) <a href=#>October 23, 2022</a></p><p>The duo hooked up again on third-and-9 with 2:13 remaining in the fourth quarter. McLaurin, more demonstrative than usual in the game thanks to some trash-talking defenders, wasn’t open even by NFL standards when Heinicke launched a pass toward the right sideline.</p><p>Trust was warranted. McLaurin snared the pass for a chain-moving 12-yard gain, the latest example of how he’s helped Heinicke’s underdog story live out loud.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>THAT'S A FIRST DOWN</p><p>📺 <a href=#>#GBvsWAS</a> FOX <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/S9BExPz2PN</a></p><p>— Washington Commanders (@Commanders) <a href=#>October 23, 2022</a></p><p>“I can”t say enough about Terry.

I can’t thank him enough for that.”</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/10/23212642/USATSI_19288214-1024x683.jpg alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Taylor Heinicke shows what Commanders have lacked (good and bad) in Carson Wentz</p></a><p>McLaurin has plenty of people to thank for helping him reach the NFL. Many of them will be at the game. He estimates 30 from his “inner circle” will be inside Lucas Oil Stadium, and 70 friends and family overall. Fortunately, the NFL’s schedule release in the spring allowed him and his parents to deal with the ticket requests long ago.</p><p>“Seeing the schedule this year … was a pretty cool moment,” McLaurin said. “My next thought was like, ‘I got to start getting on these tickets.'”</p><p>Rice cannot attend, but he’ll root for his favorite receiver, even at the expense of his favorite NFL team. McLaurin will be back playing on the same field his football hero, Harrison, once dominated.</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/10/26211305/GettyImages-1076129788-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1707 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Terry McLaurin helped Ohio State win the Big Ten title at Lucas Oil Stadium in 2017 and 2018, catching a 42-yard TD against Northwestern in 2018.

The Buckeyes were recruiting Harrison’s son, Marvin Jr., now Ohio State’s top playmaker.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“It was just the way he played the game,” McLaurin said of what he admired about the elder Harrison. “The trust that he had from Peyton Manning. That’s the kind of receiver I want to be.”</p><p>Four seasons into his NFL career, that’s who he is. Heinicke isn’t the only quarterback to express the utmost trust in McLaurin. The Indianapolis kid who signed a $71 million contract extension this summer also turned into a star player and a fan favorite.</p><p>“You just never know where your journey is going to (go),” McLaurin said. “You couldn’t have told me when I was 7 years old that I (would) be playing in the NFL. To be able to come back and share that moment with my family and close friends is going to be pretty cool.”</p><p>“But … I want to win this game. I want to keep our winning streak going. You know what I mean?”</p><p>His family, Connor Rice and hordes of others who’ve met him along the way understand what he means. They’ve seen the former little bitty dude play and win big, on and off the field, especially at Lucas Oli Stadium. Imagine the celebration if Terry McLaurin makes it happen again.</p><p>(Top photo: Darron Cummings / Associated Press)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57knBqbWxpaXxzfJFrZmpoX2eEcMDEq6myZZ2YuaLB0aKlZpuforqiusOeqaxlmaOxqq3NmmShoZederSvx6impWc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./travis-scott-remy-martin-nba-all-star-weekend-567086.html>&#171;&nbsp;Travis Scott Rings In NBA All-Star Weekend In LA</a>
