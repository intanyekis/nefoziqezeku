The actor has also contributed to the success of other movie franchises such as the Chronicles of Riddick and many others.</p><p>While he is undoubtedly the biggest public figure in his family, his siblings have also found their feet in various spheres of life and society. Let’s get to know the actor’s twin brother and half-siblings.</p><h2><strong>Vin Diesel And His Siblings Were Raised By His Step-Father</strong></h2><p>Vin Diesel and his twin brother did not know who their birth father was, and they still don’t know who he is. However, the presence of their stepfather Irving H. Vincent after their mom, Delora Sherleen Vincent, remarried meant that they did not feel the impact a father’s absence would have caused.</p><p>Born in 1934, Diesel’s stepfather worked in the movie industry as a filmmaker and producer, hence it is not much of a surprise that Diesel followed in his footsteps in the movie industry. Having been born Mark Sinclair, the Fast and Furious star opted to adopt the name Vin Diesel upon his venture into Hollywood.</p><p>The first part of that name, Vin, is a shortened version of his adoptive father’s last name while Diesel is a type of fuel and a nickname the actor earned as a youngster due to his energetic disposition.</p><p>Diesel’s mom, Delora Sherleen Vincent, an astrologer, had two other kids when she married Irvin and the family spent their early years together in an artist’s housing complex in Greenwich Village, New York City.</p><h3><strong>Vin Diesel Is The Only Twin In His Family</strong></h3><p>As previously stated, Vin Diesel has three siblings in all but he is the only twin in his family. His twin brother, Paul Vincent, is the only one he shares both parents with. When the actor posted a picture of himself and his twin brother some time ago, his fans were especially curious to find out all they could about the celebrity twin.</p><p>Let’s quickly take a look at the life of Vin Diesel’s twin brother and the kind of relationship he has with the actor.</p><h2><strong>Paul Vincent is Vin Diesel’s Twin Brother</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> July 18, 1967</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 56 years old</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Sound Engineer</li></ul><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy Birthday, Paul Vincent (twin brother of Vin Diesel)!</p><p>Might as well say… Happy Birthday to Kristen Bell too! <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/HUoV44dXnQ</a></p><p>— Birthday Buddies!! (@BirthdayBudPod) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">July 18, 2016</a></p><p>Paul Vincent might share the same parents and date of birth with the XXX: Return of Xander Cage actor, but that’s just about the similarities between the twin brothers. Just to eliminate any lingering curiosity regarding the similarities between the twins, we take the responsibility to reveal that Paul Vincent and Vin Diesel are fraternal twins.</p><p>Born in Alameda County, California alongside the star actor, Paul Vincent did not get to meet his father, and that relationship, or lack of it, has presented to date. Just like his brother, Paul Vincent had the privilege of being raised by Irving H. Vincent after his mother, Delora Sherleen’s marriage to the movie producer.</p><p>The fact that he shared the same New York City home with his twin and the rest of the family is not lost on us but what has gotten lost in circulation are the details of his formal education background. While he comes across as sufficiently educated, it is unknown whether Paul Vincent bagged a college degree.</p><p>Vin Diesel’s twin brother has relatively left the allure of the spotlight to his brother but he has contributed in his little way to ensure that the actor got to where he is at the moment. As a sound engineer, he has worked with several producers and filmmakers and was particularly influential in the making of the 1995 short movie Multi-Facial.</p><p>Incidentally, or by design, the film was written, produced, directed, and starred in by Paul’s twin brother, Vin Diesel, who had made his acting debut in 1990 but struggled to land film roles before deciding to make his own low-budget film.</p><p>Paul Vincent may not be in the spotlight as much as his twin but the brothers have a very good relationship with each other even though they look nothing like each other seeing that Vin Diesel is all muscular and bald while Paul himself has a full head of black hair with smatterings of gray in them and a less-muscular physique compared to Diesel.</p><p>Paul Vincent prefers to keep details of his personal life away from the public and the media, and so far, it appears that he is not married or has any kids. He is, however, an uncle to his brother’s three children with his model partner, Paloma Jimenez.</p><h2><strong>Vin Diesel Has Two Half Siblings</strong></h2><p>Delora Vincent’s marriage to Irving H. Vincent produced two children and that development implies that Vin Diesel has two more siblings, half-siblings to be a bit precise. His half-sister, Samantha Vincent, came first and was followed by a half-brother named Tim Vincent. Here is what we know about them.</p><h2><strong>Samantha Vincent</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 1970s</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Film Producer</li></ul><p>Samantha Vincent is Vin Diesel’s only female sibling. However, she is the actor’s maternal half-sister in the sense that they share the same mother in the person of Delora Vincent. She is the first child of the actor’s stepfather with his mother.</p><p>She was reportedly born in the 1970s although the exact particulars of her birth have yet to be revealed to the public. She grew up with her brothers and parents in New York and presumably attended high school and college there even though details of her formal educational background have yet to be revealed to the media and the public.</p><p>Samantha Vincent is a talented movie producer and has worked on several projects with her older half-brother, Vin Diesel, including the Chronicles of Riddick and several Fast & Furious films. Suffice it to say that the time they spent together on the set of several of those films has helped to bond them as siblings. Nevertheless, outside of the movie business, their relationship is just as good.</p><p>The talented movie producer has a daughter who is 10 years old as of 2022, but we have yet to figure out if she is someone’s wife or if she is just a baby mama due to her leaning toward a more secluded lifestyle in comparison to her more illustrious older half-brother.</p><h2><strong>Tim Vincent</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 1970s</li></ul><p>Tim Vincent (not to be confused with the Welsh actor of the same name) is also Vin Diesel’s half-brother but he is the most unknown of the actor’s 3 siblings. Certain outlets report that he was also born sometime in the 1970s but we have yet to confirm these sources.</p><p>It’s certainly obvious that Tim Vincent prefers life outside of the spotlight because aside from the fact that he is the half-brother of a famous actor, not much is known about him, including where he went to school and what he does for a living at the moment. It is also unknown whether he has a wife and children.</p><p>The type of relationship he has with Diesel is also something we cannot talk about but we imagine that it would be just as cordial and loving as the one the actor shares with his other siblings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunDCyKdknaGVqLKtv4ysoJukmaO0tHnGnqtmrJ9iuK%2B71mafoqtdqcSquoybqaismJq%2Fbq3NnWSsoaOpsrN7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./moistcr1tikal.html>&#171;&nbsp;MoistCr1TiKaL Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Facts, Biography</a>
