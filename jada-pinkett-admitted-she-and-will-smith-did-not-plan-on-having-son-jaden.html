During an interview, the actress and mother revealed the pregnancy wasn’t planned. She also revealed the change in lifestyle was a difficult adjustment to make.</p><p>Pinkett Smith was <a href=#>the co-host of the popular Facebook Watch series Red Table Talk</a>. The show featured open and honest conversations with her mother, daughter and special guests. Over the years, they had many memorable conversations where everything was on the table. Perhaps it is due to this level of honesty that Pinkett Smith felt comfortable enough to talk about the birth of her first child.</p><h2 id=jada-said-the-death-of-her-grandmother-caused-her-to-seek-protection-in-her-relationships>Jada Said The Death Of Her Grandmother Caused Her To Seek Protection In Her Relationships</h2><p>In May 2022, psychologist Kelly McDaniel was interviewed on an episode of Red Table Talk.

When her grandmother passed away, Pinkett Smith said that she felt that safety stripped away from her. Pinkett Smith was 13 years old when her grandmother died.</p><p>"Once she was gone, there was no safety," Pinkett Smith said. "So then I went into the world to create my own safety."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar52237791.jpg><p>Smith's mother, Adrienne Banfield-Norris, battled heroin addiction and delved deeper into substance abuse following Pinkett Smith's grandmother's death.

I don't have a really good sense of what's safe, and what's not. I'm either extremely protective or extremely defensive.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jada-revealed-that-her-mother-didn-39-t-cuddle-with-her-while-she-was-growing-up>Jada Revealed That Her Mother Didn't Cuddle With Her While She Was Growing Up</h2><p>In the same episode, <a href=#>Pinkett Smith revealed another issue in her relationship with her mother</a>. According to Pinkett Smith, one of the missing elements of their relationship was physical affection.</p><p>“One of the things that was so missing in my relationship with my mother and with Jada was just touch,” Banfield-Norris said.</p><p>Pinkett Smith said “cuddles” were uncommon in her relationship with her mother. Banfield-Norris went on to explain why this lack of physical affection was the norm for her.</p><p>“Very rarely will you see Jada and I even touch, hug,” Banfield-Norris said. “"It's awkward because we didn't hug in our family. We knew we were loved, but it just wasn't that kind of nurturing touch.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar51358379.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“She never cuddled with me,” Pinkett Smith said.</p><p>Pinkett Smith’s daughter Willow was also present for the conversation.

She also revealed she put her film career on hold. She said that it felt like she had “given up my freedom and the lifestyle I had been used to.”</p><p>“I think that I let a lot of that old Jada go that I didn’t have to,” Smith said about their new lifestyle. “It was my idea of what a mother should be, what I thought being in a family, or being in a partnership was supposed to look like. Instead of looking at myself and going, ‘What it is that I need to make me happy within this new lifestyle.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Pinkett Smith, her life began improving when she “started to take responsibility for what would make me happy.”</p><p>She added, “Having the courage to step outside all the boxes that people thought I should sit within, I got a lot more happy.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is How Jada Pinkett Smith Is Addressing The Queen Cleopatra Criticism</a></span></p><p>When asked how she felt about the success of her film Girls Trip and the Red Table Talk series, Pinkett Smith said, “It feels good, it really does.
