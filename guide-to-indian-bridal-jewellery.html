Most <a href=# title="Indian brides">Indian brides</a>, usually, go for family heirloom jewellery that has been passed down from generations and hold a tonne of sentimental value. Then there are those who like to customise their <a href=# title=jewellery>jewellery</a> according to their personal style and wedding outfits.</p><p data-score=54>Whichever camp you fall into, there’s no denying that you’ve got some important decisions to make and the countless options and kinds of bridal jewellery out there is not helping! Take a deep breath and pour yourself a soothing cup of tea, we’ve got your back.</p><p data-score=25>Take a look at our comprehensive guide to everything you need to know before selecting the jewellery for your big day…</p><h2 data-score=58>What are the different types of Bridal Jewellery?</h2><h3 data-score=0><i>Polki</i></h3><p data-score=72>These are intricately designed jewellery where uncut diamonds are set in moulds made of gold foil. In case you didn’t know, uncut means that these diamonds are not faceted or shaved to have geometric faces like we see in polished diamonds. <i>Polki</i> jewellery is timeless and classic and can be passed down through generations as heirloom jewellery.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Kundan</i></h3><p data-score=68><i>Kundan</i> jewellery is made using 24K refined gold known as <i>kundan,</i> precious or semi-precious stones, and glass. While original <i>kundan</i> jewellery is made using pure gold and precious stones, you can also go for imitation jewellery that is made using glass instead of actual stones and is, therefore, much cheaper.</p><h3 data-score=0><span><i>Meenakari</i></span><i></i><span></span></h3><p data-score=79>This gorgeous style of jewellery is favoured by brides who want a blend of modernity with tradition. <i>Meenakari</i> jewellery is characterised by the colourful lac (a type of wax) or ‘meena’ that is poured into gold moulds. Precious and semi-precious stones are also added to elevate the design. Usually, <i>meenakari</i> jewellery features distinct floral designs and patterns too.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Temple</i></h3><p data-score=47>Temple jewellery plays an important role in the cultural heritage of the southern states of India. This style of jewellery is handcrafted from gold or silver and is usually embossed with depitcions of Indian Gods and Goddesses.</p><h2 data-score=66>What are the different pieces in Indian Bridal Jewellery?</h2><h3 data-score=0><span><i>Maang Tikka</i></span><i> and M</i><span><i>atha Patti</i></span></h3><p data-score=49>This is a piece of jewellery that is worn on the forehead. While a <i>mang tikka</i> is a single chain with a pendant dangling at the top of the forehead, a <i>matha patti</i> is more elaborate and covers a larger portion of the forehead.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Necklace</i></h3><p data-score=76>Whether you’re someone who goes for traditional options or you’re a modern bride, a necklace is something you’ll have to go for to complete your look. There are many options and designs that you can pick from, based on your preferences, your outfit, and your budget. You can even layer different necklaces together to compliment your outfit and look for your wedding day.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Earrings</i></h3><p data-score=46>Your earrings should compliment the rest of your outfit and jewellery. If you’re opting for a simpler neckpiece, then you can go big on the earrings. You can even incorporate your earrings into your hairdo for the wedding.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Bangles</i></h3><p data-score=42>Bangles are an important part of Indian traditional bridal jewellery. In some cultures, you’re supposed to wear your wedding bangles, or <i>chooda,</i> for a long time after the wedding for good fortune.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Anklets and Toe Rings</i></h3><p data-score=43>This is also something that differs from region to region. An anklet or toe ring can make your feet appear delicate and beautiful. You can customise your jewellery and mehendi design to complement each other.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Haath Phool</i></h3><p data-score=48>This fine piece of jewellery adorns the back of the bride’s hand. It is usually in from of various strands that form a delicate harness. Nowadays, there are multiple options for both traditional and modern styles preferring brides.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Nose Rings</i></h3><p data-score=58>In many cultures, a nose ring is considered auspicious for marriage. The design and style of the nose ring can differ depending on different regions and cultures. If you’re not someone who is a big fan of facial piercings, then there are a tonne of clip-on options that you can go for.</p><h2 data-score=74>What are some things to consider before picking Bridal Jewellery?</h2><p data-score=51>Bridal jewellery is usually an investment and, therefore, requires special consideration and a keen eye. Here are some things you can keep in mind before going out to shop for your bridal jewellery or deciding on pieces to go with your wedding outfits.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Your Face Shape</i></h3><p data-score=107>While not the biggest or the most important factor to consider, your face shape can determine the kind of jewellery that would accentuate your best features. For instance, people with round faces should go for necklaces and earrings that are angular in shape to elongate their face and neck. Similarly, people with heart-shaped faces should go for choker-style necklaces that would make the face appear more round. However, these are not rules that are set in stone and you can go for whatever makes you feel confident and good.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Occasion</i></h3><p data-score=60>This one goes without saying but when in doubt, consider the occasion and pick the bridal jewellery accordingly. You don’t want to be the bride who shows up for her cocktail night in heavy temple jewellery now, do you? Once again, it’s best to trust your instincts and go with what feels best.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Budget</i></h3><p data-score=75>If you’re going out to buy bridal jewellery, then make sure you’re aware of the different options available in styles and materials. Jewellery is always a solid investment so don’t be afraid to take the plunge. You can also go for rental jewellery or buy imitation pieces at a much lower cost and have the freedom to customise the jewellery according to your outfit.</p><h2 data-score=62>What are the Popular Bridal Jewellery Trends of 2022?</h2><p data-score=45>While you should not let trends dictate what you should buy or not, especially when it’s something as expensive as jewellery, but there are some trends that you can follow when it comes to styling your bridal jewellery.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Statement Pieces</i></h3><p data-score=95>The holy secret of statement-making outfits is balance. If you’re going for a big, heavy neckpiece, then the rest of your bridal jewellery should be scaled back to balance the look. One of the most popular trends recently is to go for statement pieces that become the focus of the look, like shoulder duster earrings, or ginormous cocktail rings. Unsurpiringly, Rhea Kapoor is leading the pack with her choice of an intricate bejewelled veil for her own wedding outfit.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Hand Cuffs</i></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/in.hellomagazine.com/images/027a-164575db708e-3d4f24d4df51-1000/vertical-480/gold-handcuff-from-jaypore.jpg><p data-score=50>If you’re someone who likes to tread the line between modern and traditional, then you should go for wrist or hand cuffs instead of bangles. You can customise or select from a whole variety of styles and designs according to your preference.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Combinations</i></h3><p data-score=44>Brides these days are opting to pair different forms of jewellery together in eye-catching combinations. So you can go for a <i>polki</i> set with pearl strands or heavy temple jewellery with <i>kundan</i> pieces.</p><h2 data-score=51>How to take care of your Bridal Jewellery?</h2><p data-score=83>The wedding ceremony has ended and the guests have all departed. You’ve got the requisite number of carefully candid shots of you in your bridal finery and it’s now time to remove the expensive jewellery and store it somewhere safe. Before you chuck them in your jewellery box with the rest of your jewellery, here are some essential things to keep in mind to ensure they remain flawless for a long time.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Storage</i></h3><p data-score=53>It’s important to store the jewellery the right way. Keep each jewellery piece in a separate fabric-lined box. You can wrap the jewellery in a piece of tissue before storing it in the box. Additionally, add a few camphor balls to make sure moisture stays away.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Clean</i></h3><p data-score=26>Before you store them in the box, make sure the jewellery is clean. Use a soft microfiber cloth to wipe the jewellery gently.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Upkeep</i></h3><p data-score=59>One of the most important things to remember when it comes to taking care of your expensive bridal jewellery is to ensure you keep checking on them frequently. Even if you wear them regularly, get them cleaned and polished every six to eight months to make sure they remain in top condition.</p><h2 data-score=57>Bollywood Celebrities and their Bridal Jewellery</h2><p data-score=127>Over the past few years, we’ve seen a number of celebrity brides who have given us ample inspiration for our own wedding mood boards, be it from stunning locations or droolworthy outfits.

The actress looked resplendent against the Tuscan landscape in her bridal finery paired with layered <i>jadau</i> necklaces, <i>matha pattis</i>, and pearls. She added pink spinels to her jewellery to complement her ensemble.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Sonam Kapoor</i></h3><p data-score=115>The actress went full traditional for her bridal outfits and jewellery. For one of her pre-wedding ceremonies, the <i>Aisha</i> actress wore a statement choker that was gifted to her by her mother and one that had already made a public appearance on the Cannes red carpet few years earlier. Her other jewellery included a <i>guttapusalu</i> (a traditional necklace characterised by round shapes in the design and pearls at the bottom) necklace and multi-stranded <i>matha patti</i>. She also went with the traditional <i>chooda</i> set and a statement <i>haath phool</i>.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Deepika Padukone</i></h3><p data-score=108>Since <a href=# title="Deepika Padukone">Deepika Padukone</a> and <a href=# title="Ranveer Singh">Ranveer Singh</a> belong to different cultures, their wedding ceremony was also a dual celebration of their two customs. For the Konkani wedding, Padukone went with traditional temple jewellery and for the Sindhi ceremony, she opted for a<i> jadau maang tikka</i>, pearl <i>nath</i>, and an ornate choker.</p><h3 data-score=0><i>Priyanka Chopra</i></h3><p data-score=99>The global superstar’s wedding was something nobody is going to forget anytime soon. The grand wedding ceremony, which took place over three days, had her wear several gorgeous outfits and jewellery.
