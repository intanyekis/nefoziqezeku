That is, the superbly pleasing flavour which will definitely make the taste buds rejoice. What if a bottle costs hundreds of thousands? Will its cork ever be popped? Would the taste still be that pleasing? For the wine drinkers, enthusiasts and curious minds, here are the top 10 most expensive bottles of wine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-screaming-eagle-cabernet-sauvignon-1992-price-500-000><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Screaming Eagle Cabernet Sauvignon 1992 Price: $500,000</strong></h2><p>This bottle of Screaming Eagle Cabernet holds the top position for the most expensive bottle of wine that was ever sold. It is a six-liter bottle which was sold for the highest bid in 2000 by Napa Valley wine auction. Though it has a staggering $500,000 price tag, the deal was closed at a discounted price since the money was going to charity. This 1992 vintage bottle was released only in 1995.</p><h2 id=2-chateau-margaux-1787-price-225-000><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Chateau Margaux 1787 Price: $225,000</strong></h2><p>Of all the expensive wines in the world, this one probably has the most interesting story which can be quite frustrating too. The Chateau Margaux 1787 can never be resold since it no longer exists today. It is authenticated to be once part of the wine collection of Thomas Jefferson. The initial price tag that was put on it was $500,000 though there was never a chance to confirm this value. From Thomas Jefferson’s cellar, this eventually became the possession of William Sokolin who is a wine merchant. Sokolin once brought along this bottle at the Four Seasons Hotel for a Margaux dinner but it accidentally shattered because of a waiter. The amount that the insurance company paid to Sokolin surmounted to $225,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-cheval-blanc-1947-price-135-125><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Cheval Blanc 1947 Price: $135,125</strong></h2><p>In 2006, a bottle of this wine was bought at $135,125. The sale transpired in San Francisco. This amount was the price tag for a three-liter bottle. Hence, 750 ml of this expensive wine surmounts to $33,781. According to the Classification of Saint-Emilion wine, the Cheval Blanc has a class A status. Of all the merlot wines, there are only two which were granted with this classification. The impressive characteristics of this wine are because of the fact that the grapes used for it were grown during an ideal weather. The grapes grew in the months of April to October when there is little amount of rain and the temperature was warm.</p><h2 id=4-chateau-d-yquem-1811-price-117-000><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Chateau d’Yquem 1811 Price: $117,000</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Usually, white wine costs less than red wine but the Chateau d’Yquem 1811 surpassed many red wines. This bottle is also a sweet Sauternes. The year it was produced was known as a comet year. In the wine industry, it is believed that wines which are produced during a comet year are extraordinarily flavorful. It was Christian Vanneque, a wine connoisseur and owner of wine bar in Indonesia, who bought this bottle for $117,000. The selling price of this bottle defeated the Chateau d’Yquem 1787, which was sold at $100,000.</p><h2 id=5-chateau-mouton-rothschild-1945-price-47-000><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Chateau Mouton-Rothschild 1945 Price: $47,000</strong></h2><p>The entire set of the Chateau Mouton-Rothschild was place on auction by Sotheby’s New York and the highest bid reached $310,700. Hence, each bottle which contains 750 ml costs about $47,000. Before the auction, this was in possession of the personal cellar of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild’s owner. This wine bottle is celebrated in the industry because of its aromatic scent which has a hint of eucalyptus. The crest on the bottle is another factor which makes it even more costly. The “V” sign which signifies restoration of peace was an idea of Baron Philippe.</p><h2 id=6-massandra-sherry-de-la-frontera-1775-price-43-500><strong>6.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Massandra Sherry de la Frontera 1775 Price: $43,500</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This holds the highest price for a bottle of sherry. The jaw-dropping price for this wine is because of its age. This vintage wine is authenticated as the oldest European wine. It was produced by Massandra Winery which is in Russia. This winery is known across the world as the one with the most extensive collection of Russian and European wine which have an Imperial Seal. In 2001, Massandra 1775 was sold at Sotheby’s London.</p><h2 id=7-penfolds-grange-hermitage-1951-price-38-420><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Penfolds Grange Hermitage 1951 Price: $38,420</strong></h2><p>This is considered as the most expensive among the different types of wine produced in Australia. According to records, there are only 20 bottles which still exists today. In 2004, an Australian wine auction house had a bottle that is up for bidding. An Adelaide wine collector paid a whopping AUS$50,200. The grape variety used for this was 100% Shiraz, wherein 50% is Magill and 50% is Morphett Vale. It has 13.5% of alcohol.</p><h2 id=8-royal-de-maria-price-30-000><strong>8.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Royal De Maria &nbsp;Price: $30,000</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Royal De Maria is also labeled as ice wine. It means that the grapes which are used in creating it were first frozen on the vine before being used for fermentation. The tedious process involved in its production is one reason why it is so pricey. Because of its flavor, connoisseurs determined this to be perfect for desserts. It was in 2006 when a bottle of this wine was sold at $30,000.</p><h2 id=9-romanee-conti-1945-price-28-112><strong>9.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Romanee-Conti 1945 Price: $28,112</strong></h2><p>A single bottle of the Romanee-Contee has a whopping price tag of $28,112. There were actually seven bottles of this white wine, along with Montrachet. When this was placed at an auction by Sotheby’s London in 1996, the entire set of eight bottles surmounts to $224,900. The main reason why this wine costs so much is because of the complexity involved in creating a single bottle of it. It was produced in France where the soil has minimal produce. To be able to fill one bottle, it is necessary to exhaust all harvest from three Pinot Noir grape vines.</p><h2 id=10-chateau-lafite-1865-price-27-000><strong>10.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Chateau Lafite 1865 Price: $27,000</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The price tag for a double-magnum bottle is $27,000 which is authenticated to be 150 years old. Each bottle contains 750 ml of fine wine. The total price for the set is $111,625. Originally, the set was in possession of a businessman from Florida. Then a wine collector from Europe purchased this and the negotiation was merely done via the telephone.</p><h2></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8yoqq1lla29prrSoq2eZZKkwbW4xKxkqJ5drLavsY4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./nick-gordon-second-arrest-574904.html>&#171;&nbsp;Nick Gordon Arrested For Second Time In Two Weeks</a>
