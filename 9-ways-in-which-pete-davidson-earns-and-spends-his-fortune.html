massive fan following for quite some time</a>, but lately, he has been the recipient of far more attention than usual. Now that he's officially and publicly dating Kim Kardashian, his name has been dominating the headlines, and he has generated a lot more interest among fans. People that may not have otherwise tuned in to see him during his comedy shows, or on Saturday Night Live are now taking interest in learning more about his life and career. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pete Davidson is a true success story. </a>His tale is one of<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> a young man that took the art of comedy to a whole new level,</a> and has managed to amass an impressive $8 million fortune at the very young age of just 28 years old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=earns-saturday-night-live>Earns: Saturday Night Live</h2><p>For most fans, Pete Davidson's biggest claim to fame is his recurring role on Saturday Night Live. He joined when he was just 20 years old, becoming one of the youngest actors to have ever joined the cast. Davidson's bubbly, charming personality and his natural ability to make people laugh has proven to be a real asset to the show. He has a hysterical, overly exaggerated way of executing his lines, and his facial expressions speak to the true farce acting that is required from his role. Fans have enjoyed watching him refine his skills with each performance, and have seen him grow and develop in front of the cameras.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Davidson uses his own life experiences as a foundation for the comedy sketches he participates in on the show and this has made him both relatable and likable to fans. He's able to poke fun at his own life, laugh at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his controversial moments, </a>and to take comedic approach to conversations that would otherwise be mundane without his interpretation.</p><p>Although the folks at Saturday Night Live have kept the earnings of their cast members low key, it is believed that Pete earns roughly $15,000- $25,00 per episode, leading to a rough estimation of $500,000 per year from this gig alone.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Look At Pete Davidson's Journey To Building An $8 Million Fortune</a></span></p><h2 id=spends-real-estate>Spends: Real Estate</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pete Davidson is one of the few celebrities that doesn't engage with his fanbase on social media. He is also among the rare breed of famous faces that lives a low key lifestyle and doesn't flaunt his tremendous wealth in front of the media. He doesn't spend his money frivolously and tends to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> keep his financial status low key and under wraps</a>. He's not the type to showcase his earnings, but he definitely lives well. He has been known to snatch up property, and has recently purchased a $1.2 million <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Staten Island condominium </a>which boasts incredible views and state of the art upgrades.</p><p>The incredible waterfront condo boasts two bedrooms and two-and-a-half bathrooms, and features stunning panoramic views overlooking Manhattan.</p><h2 id=earns-stand-up-comedy>Earns: Stand Up Comedy</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In his earlier days, Pete Davidson got&nbsp;his first televised special on Gotham Comedy Live, and performed at the Gotham Comedy Club in New York City.&nbsp; He has dominated in the world of comedy, by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">headlining a number of stand-up specials,</a> including Pete Davidson: SMD, which ran in April of 2016. He took his comedic antics to another level with Alive From New York, and by providing the voice of Phineas on The Freak Brothers, for a total of ten hysterical episodes.</p><p>He rakes in the dollars with ticket sales, making huge profits from his comedy tours.</p><h2 id=spends-his-love-life>Spends: His Love Life</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pete Davidson has been linked to a number of leading ladies</a>, among them being the very prominent Ariana Grande and Kim Kardashian. Of course, he makes sure to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> spend some of his hard-earned dollars on his ladies </a>and seems to splurge with ease in this area.</p><p>During his brief engagement to Ariana Grande, Pete Davidson dropped $93,000 on her engagement ring, which was commissioned by Greg Yuna, a highly respected New York Jeweler. It took him nearly two weeks to complete the ring design.</p><p>These days, he's wining and dining Kim Kardashian, a lady that is very much accustomed to living a lavish lifestyle. Between dinners out and the fancy vacation they took together in the Bahamas, Pete has surely been doing some very big spending.</p><h2 id=earns-movies>Earns: Movies</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pete's exposure to the public hasn't been limited to the comedic genre, and has far exceeded the small screen. He happens to have starred in a number of prominent movies, as well. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He joined the likes of Margot Robbie, John Cena, Sylvester Stalone and Idris Elba</a> on the set of Suicide Squad, playing the role of Richard.</p><p>He has also enjoyed big roles, and big paychecks for his role in&nbsp;Set It Up, Big Time Adolescence, and&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Staten Island.</p><h2 id=spends-the-staten-island-ferry>Spends: The Staten Island Ferry</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pete Davidson doesn't splurge on many elaborate items for himself, but this year, he did take an interesting leap into a major personal investment. He joined forces with friend and fellow Saturday Night Live cast mate Colin Jost, and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> bought the Staten Island Ferry</a>, and dropped $280,100.00 for those bragging rights.&nbsp; Interestingly, the ferry can't even start or move on its own accord. The decommissioned, abandoned ferry is a Staten Island landmark and now, one of the region's most famous citizens lays claims on the ship.</p><p>Davidson and Jost have plans to turn the Ferry into a floating night club, and entertainment center, and are in the process of making arrangements for the transformation of the ferry.</p><h2 id=earns-the-king-of-staten-island>Earns: The King Of Staten Island</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Proving his true talent is limitless, Pete Davidson didn't just act in The King Of Staten Island, he also happened to be the writer, too. Director Judd Apatow oversaw this project, and gave Pete Davidson the opportunity to share his tale with his fans. This production unfolded as a semi-biographical take on his life and followed the tale of a young man that dropped out of highschool and was trying to find himself and get his life on track.</p><p>The high budget movie cost $35 million to produce and was said to have only generated $2.2 million in revenue, making it a box office failure. However, Davidson was paid handsomely for his contributions, and layered his bank account with earnings from his dual role as both actor and script writer for this production.</p><h2 id=spends-a-little-mercedes-collection>Spends: A Little Mercedes Collection</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike many celebrities that purchase<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> fleets of luxury cars </a>and supercars, and flaunt images of themselves posing up next to their very expensive rides, Pete Davidson has publicly declared that he really doesn't care much for cars at all. However, he owns an S-Class Mercedes, as well as the ultra expensive Mercedes G Wagon.</p><p>Fans that questioned why a self proclaimed 'car indifferent' person would purchase two very expensive Mercedes Benz vehicles didn't have to search far for an answer. Pete's grandfather had always dreamt of one-day owning an S Class Mercedes. He's older in age and can't drive himself regularly, but Pete Davidson bought one to take him out in, and has let his grandfather drive it around town from time to time, giving him an opportunity to live out his dreams.</p><h2 id=earns-endorsements-in-the-fashion-industry>Earns: Endorsements In The Fashion Industry</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The unique and daring fashion items worn by Pete Davidson have attracted a number of designers, and&nbsp;this has developed into yet&nbsp;another lucrative venture for the young star. He was featured on the cover of GQ Magazine, which in itself is a huge honor. He has also teamed up with his good pal, Machine Gun Kelly, and starred in Calvin Klein's promotional campaign. This exploded on Instagram and created an other income stream for Davidson.</p><p>He has also enjoyed lucrative endorsement deals with Moose Knuckles and Smartwater, to name a few.</p><p>Although he has already seen a great deal of success in his career, and has already secured his fame and fortune, Pete Davidson's star continues to rise, and it's expected that he'll continue to generate many more millions in the years to come.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>9 Ways Seth Rogen Earns And Spends His Multi-Million-Dollar Fortune</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dodbuzz</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life and Style Magazine</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Motorbiscuit</a>,&nbsp; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e5hmrpqxo2K2r3nWoaCcoF2lsrWxjJ2Yr6GUqLyvecSaqaerXZa7pXnSqZynnKNitaq%2FjJ%2Bmq6ylo7Jw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./outrage-after-ex-nfl-player-brings-stripper-to-event-at-michigan-high-school.html>&#171;&nbsp;Outrage after ex-NFL player brings stripper to event at Michigan high school</a>
