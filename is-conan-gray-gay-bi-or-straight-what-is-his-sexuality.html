What is His Sexuality?</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 5 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/FV4vMoVX0AEzhkp-scaled-e1660766918423.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><strong>Conan Gray has neither identified as gay nor straight, but there are speculations that he might either be gay or bisexual.</strong></p><p>Rumors about the American singer’s sexuality have always been a hot topic for discussion, and the major reasons stem from his choice of fashion items and style. The ‘Heather’ singer is also an unapologetic supporter of the pride community, which has given his fans a lot of reasons to ship him off as gay. His music videos have also featured both men and women as his love interests but be that as it may, he doesn’t want a label placed on his sexuality.</p><h2><strong>Is Conan Gray Gay or Straight?</strong></h2><p>Though there is no official confirmation from him, Conan Gray might be gay or just like both genders. When he posted a picture of him and Matty Healy cozying up to each other in early December 2019, the internet went crazy with speculations flying around about his relationship status without confirmation from the singer. He also has a friend named Ashley, whom he refers to as his boyfriend, but no further details are provided.</p><p>Overall, Conan Gray has always made it clear that he doesn’t want to be labeled either gay or straight as he just wants to exist. One of his 2018 tweets expressed anger over the way people are trying to put a tag on him just for their own satisfaction, but he is not having any of it. He tweeted: “Y’all are so annoying all y’all ever wanna do is place a label on me just let me fuckin exist what the fuck.”</p><p>The singer added that he understands that some people find it helpful to categorize everyone’s sexuality, but that pattern doesn’t sit well with him. For him, gender and sexuality issues should just be left to rest and allow people to enjoy their lives the best way they deem fit.</p><p>“If labels on sexuality and gender and beliefs and all that great stuff are helpful for u, I’m all for it. But the second you start trying to shove everyone else into a neat little easy-to-understand box, I get mad. Stop!”</p><p>While he may not be direct when talking about his sexuality, Conan has shared some of his past experiences as a young child trying to find his true self. He was also bullied a lot and some of the things he endured in his childhood and teens are common in the rainbow community.</p><h2><strong>Is Conan Gray Bisexual?</strong></h2><p>Some pictures, videos, and statements coming from the singer have certainly hinted that he is gay or at most bisexual. Conan has also used both male and female actors to pose as his love interest in his music videos which points to his being bisexual.</p><p>However, he has not put a label on his sexuality and doesn’t look like he wants to be identified as anything other than himself. Conan is still averse to being put in a box and has said he finds it annoying when people try to analyze his sexual orientation.</p><p>The musician is very private with his love life, and even when he talks about his past affairs, he hides the pronouns to avoid giving any gender away. His current partner is also not known as he is always particular about keeping such matters private.</p><h3><strong>He Hints At His Sexual Orientation in His Music and Videos</strong></h3><p>While he doesn’t talk much about his love life, Conan’s music always comes with a love theme, and we have seen him mingle with both men and women as his love interests. His 2021 track ‘Astronomy,’ released on May 7th, is all about heartbreak and watching the person you love fall out of love with you.</p><p>Through his song ‘Heather’, which introduced him to the spotlight, Conan Gray explored his past love interest and how his high school had eyes for another girl named Heather. From the lyrics, it’s easy to see that the crush is a boy, even though he would rather not share that aspect of his love life. The song shares his pain at the time, seeing his crush going after Heather instead of giving him attention.</p><p>However, instead of hating Heather, Conan shares his admiration for her gentleness and beauty. Her stunning appearance makes him understand why his crush chose her over him. In the end, Conan tries to switch between masculine and feminine traits to appear soft and sweet, just like Heather, in order to attract his crush.</p><p>Apparently, his tactics didn’t make much difference as his crush remained his crush and nothing more. In fact, Conan has confessed that by age 12, he had already experienced a lot of heartbreaks, and this is why he is drawn to Adele’s music as they relate with him a lot.</p><h2><strong>Who is Conan Gray Dating?</strong></h2><p>This is a question you will probably not get an answer to from the YouTuber himself, as he likes to keep his affairs private. However, he has been linked to different people of both genders, but he is yet to confirm any of the claims.</p><p>Olivia Rodrigo, an American singer-songwriter and actress, is one of the people linked to Conan Gray romantically. Conan and Olivia were both part of the crew Taylor Swift used to leak two of her records before the official release of ‘Fearless.’ In the process, the duo filmed two videos together, where they looked like there is a lot of chemistry between them.</p><p>The interest then went from Taylor Swift’s songs to the supposed couple as the internet went crazy about the potential relationship. It later turned out that they were just being professional. According to Olivia Rodrigo, they are just friends. In addition to being platonic friends, they are also linked professionally as they share the same music producer.</p><p>Nevertheless, when Conan released his song ‘Astronomy’ a month later, some people chose to link it to Olivia as the track talks about gradual heartbreak. The closest thing to a relationship Conan has let off is his friend Ashley whom he calls his boyfriend, but nothing more is known about this friend. He also shared some loved-up pictures with Matty Healy on Instagram but in typical Conan style, he didn’t spill the beans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunC10maaqKaRo3qovsCyZKCZqWKvqnnOq2SsrKKWtqi002auoZmkYra0eceiqmarla3CorjIrbBo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./julian-henry-de-niro.html>&#171;&nbsp;Julian Henry De Niro</a>
