The innocent 15-year-old lost his life to Fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid that has been responsible for many overdoses in recent times. Layno’s story illuminates the dangers of drug abuse and the need to stay vigilant against counterfeit medication.</p><p>In this article, we will pay tribute to the life of Layno Ramos and raise awareness about Fentanyl’s devastating effects. Keep reading more.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_was_Layno_Ramos></span><strong>Who was Layno Ramos?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Layno Ramos was much more than just a name. He was a vibrant and loving young man who touched the lives of everyone he met, and was taken from this world far too soon due to an unfortunate incident. Born on July 7th, 2004 in Yakima, Washington, Layno was a doting son, a caring brother, and a loving uncle who was known for his kind heart, friendly nature, and infectious smile. With a passion for soccer, video games, and spending time with his buddies, Layno was always an uplifting presence in the lives of those around him. Although his untimely death has left a permanent void in their lives, his family and friends will always cherish the memories of Layno and the joy that he brought to their lives.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_was_the_cause_of_his_death></span><strong>What was the cause of his death?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The cause of Layno’s death was Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that can be up to 100 times more potent than morphine. Fentanyl is typically used to treat severe pain, but it has increasingly become a drug of abuse due to its high potency and availability. Many drug dealers have been known to lace drugs like Oxycontin, Percocet, and other prescription pills with Fentanyl to increase their potency and profits. Counterfeit drugs like the blue M30 pills, which Layno was given, are often sold on the streets and can be deadly.</p><p>One of the most heartbreaking aspects of Layno’s case is the fact that the individuals he considered friends played a role in his tragic death. These individuals provided him with a counterfeit pill, knowing full well the danger it posed. Even more disturbing was their decision not to call for medical assistance when Layno was unconscious, instead choosing to take photos and share them on social media.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=GoFundMe_Amanda_Ramirez_is_organising_this_fundraising_appeal_on_behalf_of_Erica_Gutierrez></span><strong>GoFundMe: Amanda Ramirez is organising this fundraising appeal on behalf of Erica Gutierrez</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Layno Ramos was born on July 7th, 2004 and went to be with the Lord on Tuesday, May 26th, 2020. He was a loving son, brother, and father. Leaving behind his mother Lucia Gutierrez, father Cristobal Ramos, sister Erica Perez, brother-in-law Carlos Perez, and sister Neomie Gonzalez Layno, he knew who God was and loved him. He was known to light up the room with his smile and laughter. Layno attended Davis High School, where he played football and enjoyed spending time with his friends. Let us not only remember how he left us but also his legacy and how kind, loving, and warm-hearted he was. God gained another angel. His family appreciates any help they can get to cover the costs of sending Layno home to be with his mother in Mexico. There will be a viewing for Layno on Sunday, May 31st, at Brookside Funeral Home in Moxee from 2–5 p.m. The facility will allow only 30 people in at a time, practising social distancing as well, but everyone will have their opportunity to say goodbye to Layno. Thank you, and God bless.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=Layno_Ramos_Obituary></span><strong>Layno Ramos Obituary</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Layno Ramos’s story is one that reminds us how quickly a life can be taken away by drug abuse. It is vital to remember that drugs like Fentanyl can be deadly, and users must always remain cautious. Layno’s family and friends will always hold him close in their hearts, remembering him for the beautiful person he was. May his story encourage us all to remain mindful of the dangers of drug abuse and protect those we love from its devastating effects.</p><p>Layno’s passing has highlighted the need for greater education and awareness about the dangers of drug abuse. Parents, friends, and family members must remain vigilant and watchful when it comes to the use of prescription medication. It is essential to take precautions and ensure that pills are obtained from a legitimate source and used only as intended.
