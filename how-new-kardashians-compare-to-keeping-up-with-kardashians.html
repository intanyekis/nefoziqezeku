The Kardashians is poised to be a standard continuation of their original show Keeping Up With The Kardashians but with a few subtle differences. It is also important to note that their departure from E! comes at the same time as the family has indulged<a href=#> in a legal battle with Blac Chyna</a>, Rob Kardashian's ex. This is what fans can expect from the new series.</p><h2 id=it-will-include-the-whole-family-but-less-of-the-jenner-girls><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>It Will Include The Whole Family, But Less Of The Jenner Girls</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keeping Up With The Kardashians followed the lives of the entire Kardashian and Jenner clan, through thick and thin. We followed Kim's relationships over the years, and we watched Caitlyn and Kris Jenner's two youngest children, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner, grow up and turn into supermodels and entrepreneurs. The entire family will be a part of the new Hulu show as well. But Kris and her eldest daughters have made it clear that the new series will focus and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revolve around Kris, Kim, Khloe, and Kourtney</a>. The Jenner girls will be around too, but they have stepped back to focus on their thriving enterprises.</p><h2 id=we-will-follow-kim-kardashian-39-s-journey-into-law><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>We Will Follow Kim Kardashian's Journey Into Law</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans are speculating what plotlines the new Hulu show will follow, but fans are eager and hopeful that we will get a closer look into Kim Kardashian's journey to becoming a lawyer in the state of California. Speculation already abounds all over the internet over what kind of lawyer Kim will be, however, it is well known she is working with high-profile civil rights and human rights lawyers. Also, her father Rob Kardashian was an incredibly successful criminal attorney, and she might be eager to follow in her father's footsteps. In any case, if her journey into law is not a plotline we get to see, the showrunners are making a big mistake.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Kind Of Lawyer Will Kim Kardashian Be?</a></span></p><h2 id=kanye-isn-39-t-involved><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kanye Isn't Involved</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We might see how Kanye's relentless stalking is affecting Kim's mental health and her relationship with her children, but we are not likely to see her rapper ex-husband anytime soon. As anyone with a pulse is well aware, Kanye is not exactly handling their divorce well, <a href=#>or even showing proper respect to the mother of his children</a>. We saw Kanye quite a bit in the other show, but he will be absent in the new one. Maybe we'll see a few episodes with Kim's new beau, Pete Davidson.</p><h2 id=fans-are-speculating-about-travis-scott><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Fans Are Speculating About Travis Scott</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the Jenners will be less a part of the show than their elder sisters, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans wonder if they will have any plotlines</a> in the series, particularly Kylie who is in the midst of some intense off-camera drama with the father of her child, rapper Travis Scott. Scott is in the middle of some intense legal trouble because he has been accused of gross negligence for his conduct at his Astroworld Festival, which resulted in the deaths of several people including multiple children. Fans want to know how this is affecting Kylie. Will it be in the show? There is only one way to find out, so make sure your Hulu fees are paid up if you want to see it.</p><h2 id=they-left-e-on-slightly-negative-terms><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>They Left E! On Slightly Negative Terms</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Kardashian-Jenners were E!'s anchor for almost 20 seasons. It is arguably the most successful show in the network's history and losing new episodes to Hulu is a major blow to the network and its future. Also, as the Kardashians are caught up in a legal battle with Blac Chyna, the family was not happy with how the network handled the conflict. Allegedly, the Kardashians were asking the network to cancel the show to shut down Blac Chyna's abusive behavior. The network refused and now they lost their most profitable show. The move to Hulu was not just a business decision, it is the family's middle finger to their old network.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Astroworld Victimâs Family Lawyer Accuses Travis Scott Of Dodging Responsibility</a></span></p><h2 id=politics-might-be-a-factor><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Politics Might Be A Factor</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is pure speculation, but as Kim Kardashian follows her path into a legal career some speculate she will up her already increasing political activism. Kim has already been instrumental in the release of a human trafficking victim from prison, and we already know politics was a factor in her divorce from Kanye West. Kim is a vocal Democrat and was not okay with Kanye's endorsement of Donald Trump. Will we see more of Kim's political activism in the show? Probably.</p><h2 id=the-kardashians-will-have-creative-control><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Kardashians Will Have Creative Control</span></h2><p>Although the show will depend on the work of the showrunners to operate, as Keeping Up With The Kardashians did, Kim, Khloe, Kris, and Kourtney will have more say and creative control than they ever did on E! What that will look like we don't know yet, but fans are can enjoy the fact that the Kardashians are in control of their show in a way they never had before.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=#> So Why Did The Kardashians Leave E!
