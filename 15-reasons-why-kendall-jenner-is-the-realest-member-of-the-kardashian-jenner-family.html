might be safe to say that most people think of <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>. After all, she was kind of famous before the rest of her sisters and is sometimes credited for being the reason her family is at the level of fame and success they are today. Not to mention, <a href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a> and <a href=#>Kendall Jenner</a> are not too far behind when it comes to the celebrity race the Kardashian and Jenners might be leading.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, there is a completely different answer when fans think about the realest member of the Kardashian/Jenner clan. Rob Kardashian was the king of that title for quite a while. He always seemed to be the one who could set his sisters straight and never fell for their shenanigans. But he got caught up himself when he started dating <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a>’s arch nemesis, Black Chyna, who is also the mother of Kylie’s boyfriend Tyga's son. Just messy, so messy. But honestly, that’s where Kendall comes in as the one member of the family who seems to get it right. She’s not publicly concerned about being in the spotlight or flaunting her latest Givenchy find. Instead, Kendall seems to be the sister who’s usually in the cut and hard to find; that is, unless you’re looking on a runway. Interestingly enough, she’s almost considered the new golden child of the family. So I can think of a few reasons why Kendall is the realest member of the Kardashian-Jenner family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-didn-t-want-to-do-kuwtk-in-its-early-days>She Didn't Want To Do KUWTK In Its Early Days</h2><p>Kendall might be a major reality star now, but she didn’t always want it to be that way. She and Kylie Jenner literally grew up before our eyes on the show as they were just kids when <i>Keeping Up With The Kardashians </i>first started in 2007. But Kendall’s genuine status and realness was present even back then as she revealed in an interview that she wasn’t interested in joining her big sisters on camera. “When we were younger we would come home from school and they would be filming and they would be like ‘Oh come in the room, come hang out with us’ and we would be like, ‘No I want to go do my homework.’ So there was like a moment where we were like not as into it.” Kendall and Kylie might not have had much of a childhood in front of the cameras, but they definitely had a few good moments (remember the episode when Rob Kardashian tricked Bruce into thinking he was drinking beer with his then teenage sisters?).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-dropped-her-last-name>She Dropped Her Last Name</h2><p>Kendall showed she was serious about her modeling career when she revealed she did everything she could to separate herself from her famous family; that includes removing her last name when she auditioned for modeling jobs.The agency she was signed with, Society Management, also only listed her as “Kendall” while the other ladies, like the notable <a href=#>Adrianna Lima</a>, had their full name posted under their headshots. “People didn’t want to take a chance on me, I think because I was sort of known,” she told <i>Teen Vogue. </i>“They were a little bit on the fence about it. Some people might think that what I’ve done made it easier for me to get jobs, but it was actually a disadvantage. I had to work harder.” And that she certainly did! Now, she’s right in line with becoming one of the most known supermodels. From gaining her Victoria’s Secret wings to strutting the catwalk for New York Fashion Week, Kendall is definitely taken seriously as a model. Maybe taking off Jenner really did help.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-doesn-t-give-her-haters-much-attention>She Doesn't Give Her Haters Much Attention</h2><p>While her sisters and even brother and sometimes mother and father have no problem popping off at their haters and giving them a piece of their mind, Kendall is rarely seen doing this, if ever. And it’s not that she doesn’t get spewed any hate (what Kardashian doesn’t?). Somehow, Kendall is able to maintain her cool, calm, and collected composure despite the criticism that she receives. She probably knows that clapping back doesn’t do anything but add fuel to the fire and maybe cause you to be a feature on a gossip site. But that clearly isn’t Kendall’s goal in life. Because in the rare moment she does offer up a response, it’s usually a classy one to set the record straight about a rumor that’s been going around about her. And I can’t really blame her for wanting to speak out on those things to clear the air.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-she-the-only-one-with-talent>Is She The Only One With Talent?</h2><p>Her modeling has certainly catapulted her into a different category of fame than her siblings. I’m not saying Kendall is more famous than Kylie, Khloe, Rob, Kim, or Kourtney. But I think everyone can agree that her type of fame is not the same. When the Kardashian name comes up, no matter how famous they are, the ringing question is, “What are they famous for, exactly?” Remember when <a href=#>Barbara Walters</a> did an interview with them for the 10 Most Fascinating People feature? She literally told Kim, Khloe, Kourtney, and Kris that they didn’t have talent. Other than their reality show, they really haven’t been known to have talent other than being entrepreneurs. But Kendall doesn’t fall into that section. She’s been featured in major ads from Calvin Klein to Revlon and has proven herself to be a major model and down-to-earth star. This is just one of the many ways she’s more real than her family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-honest-about-caitlyn-jenner>She’s Honest&nbsp;About Caitlyn Jenner</h2><p>Kendall Jenner was just one of the people in the huge family impacted by her father Bruce Jenner’s transition into womanhood as <a href=#>Caitlyn Jenner</a>. But she has been able to stay extremely real about it. She never really offered an answer that seemed politically correct or tried to tear Caitlyn down for the lies that were told along the journey. Instead, she provides what seems like a very true, authentic, and relatable perspective to the change. Even more than year after the transition was announced, Kendall confessed she was dealing with it despite having hints of it long before it actually happened (she once revealed a time she caught Bruce walking around in women’s clothes and makeup in the middle of the night). Something like this would be tough for any family, but Kendall was one of the people who appeared to reveal her true feelings about it as the Kardashians and Jenners went through this together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-plastic-surgery-here>No Plastic Surgery Here?</h2><p>It doesn’t get any more real than still having the body that you were actually born with. From Kylie’s lip fillers, to Kourtney's breast implants, to Kris Jenner’s decision to get Botox on the regular (and a face lift), Kendall might be the only family member who has not undergone plastic surgery, with the exception of Rob of course. Still, it’s not surprising that there is speculation that Kendall has received plastic surgery. There were even rumors that she deleted her Instagram so she could get her face redone. She recently shut down the rumors and spoke specifically on reports that she was taking after her younger sister and starting a journey to fuller lips. “I was like, this is crazy… It’s all so exhausting. As a model, why would I have my face reconstructed? It doesn’t even make sense. It’s crazy because sometimes I feel like people just want me to lose.” Not us, Kenny! We’re rooting for you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-kim-kardashian-jealous>Is Kim Kardashian Jealous?</h2><p>It’s safe to say Kendall Jenner officially dethroned Kim Kardashian from being the most popular and well known Kardashian/Jenner sibling quite a bit of time ago. There was speculation that Kim was even “jealous” of Kendall and her then newfound level of fame a few years ago. Word spread that Kim was livid that Kendall started to book major deals, such as the one with Estee Lauder back in 2014. Around that time, Kendall also revealed she didn’t want Kim to support her at her runway&nbsp;shows. Kendall said she wanted to prove that she had earned the gig and didn’t want it to get mixed in with Kim. Both sisters have denied any beef or feuds between them. But just like all sisters, and family in general, do, they have had plenty of their moments. The only difference is theirs air on television for millions to see on E!’s <i>Keeping Up With The Kardashians.</i></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-doesn-t-want-a-momager-around-at-all-times>She Doesn’t Want A Momager Around At All Times</h2><p>Kendall tries to go great lengths to separate herself from her family, and Kim isn’t the only family member she wanted to steer clear of her career in its early days. In one episode of <i>Keeping Up With The Kardashians, </i>Kendall seemed ecstatic to announce that she landed a spot in a fashion show during Paris Fashion Week. But her entire demeanor changed when the infamous momager announced she would be tagging along too. Kendall was extremely real and had no problem in letting her mom know she didn’t want her anywhere near the fashion show. In some ways, this is just like any young adult telling a parent to back off just a tad. However, we all know that Kendall is not a regular teenager. And she was fully aware that her mother (and sisters) could be a distraction from her career that was just beginning to blossom at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-experienced-bullying>She’s Experienced Bullying</h2><p>Kendall Jenner might not have had a normal childhood, but she certainly can relate to teenagers who have experienced bullying. It was widely reported that the reality star turned supermodel experienced lots of teasing from her modeling peers who thought she didn’t belong in their world. Word is some of those bullying tactics went into full effect when Jenner made her debut on the runway at New York Fashion Week at one of the most coveted shows. Apparently backstage was a show of its own as one insider revealed to In Touch, “The other models worked so hard to get a spot on the runway and didn’t think it was fair she was there. Some [of the models] put out their cigarettes in Kendall’s drink. They thought she was getting special treatment and just weren’t OK with it.” But look at her now! She’s wining and dining with the best of them just a couple of years later. It doesn’t get any more real than that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-said-she-s-not-like-her-sisters>She Said She’s Not Like Her Sisters</h2><p>Kendall herself said she’s not like her sisters. She might not have said the exact words that these differences make her anymore authentic or real than her fellow Kardashian/Jenner family members, but reading between the lines it could definitely still apply. “I’ve always been super different from all my sisters, especially my Kardashian sisters. They’ve always been into the glam thing and dressing up every day and being in the thick of it,” she told Mirror<i>. </i>And despite being a supermodel herself, Kendall admitted she’s not really into that type of thing. “Part of me loves that, but at the same time, I love dressing down and having my private life.” Interestingly enough, Kendall is arguably the one that most people want to know more about considering she’s out of the spotlight. It brings a new level of mystery that the rest of her family doesn’t have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-steals-clothes-from-kylie>She Steals Clothes From Kylie</h2><p>Kendall Jenner might be a fashionista but she has no problem stealing her youngest sister, Kylie Jenner’s, clothes. She revealed her crime on her own website and wrote, “I always used to steal clothes from Kylie when she was out of the house. I’d wait until she’d go downstairs, and then I’d strike! She was the easiest target because we were the exact same size!” She went on to add that it didn’t hurt that Kylie would get the most upset out of all of her sisters. <i>Keeping Up With The Kardashians </i>viewers knew this to be all too true on an episode of the show when the ladies literally got into a screaming match (and called one another names that are never suitable for television) because Kyle wouldn’t let Kendall wear one of her dresses to the 2015 ESPY Awards. Even Kendall isn’t too big of a star to “borrow” clothes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-was-the-first-to-cover-vogue-solo>She Was The First To Cover Vogue Solo</h2><p>Kendall Jenner made Kardashian and Jenner history when she became the first sister to cover the fashion bible, Vogue magazine. Yes, Kim Kardashian was the first one to grace the cover, but she did so with her then-fiancee <a href=#>Kanye West</a>. As for Kendall, she was the first of the sisters to do it alone. And on top of that, she covered the most popular issue of the magazine: the September cover. Girls and guys wait for this magazine to arrive every year as they anticipate what the top fashions of the year will be. And Kendall was the one to give it to them. The magazine classified her as “the most relatable supermodel ever.” Not that it needs my approval, but I certainly agree that Kendall is pretty down-to-earth. It’s safe to say that Kendall showed elegance, style, and grace during this big moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-not-into-messy-drama>She’s Not Into Messy Drama</h2><p>It’s no secret Kendall has been considered the standout member of the Kardashian Jenner family. And the funny thing is, she does so without even trying to be in the public eye and steering clear of drama, unlike her sisters. From Khloe Kardashian’s series of boyfriends (i.e. James Harden, Tristan Thompson, reportedly O’dell Beckham, Jr., etc.), Kourtney Kardashian’s back-and-forth with Scott Disick, Kim Kardashian’s decision to leak Kanye West’s conversation with <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, Rob Kardashian’s drama with Blac Chyna, Kylie Jenner’s unspeakable drama with her boyfriend Tyga (who is also the father of Kylie’s brother’s ex-fiance’s child), Kris Jenner’s very public issues, and Caitlyn’s major transition, Kendall is easily considered the most normal and probably realest member of the family. It’s clear she goes through drama of her own, but it’s not a messy type of drama that almost seems opportunistic; it’s probably the type of drama that all of us have - which is another reason that Kendall is the realest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-has-learned-from-her-sisters-mistakes>She Has Learned From Her Sisters' Mistakes</h2><p>Kendall might be considered the only Kardashian Jenner sister with talent, but she isn’t afraid to admit she has learned a thing or two (maybe even three) from her big sisters. She opened up about it to Australian television show <i>Today </i>and said, “[Kylie and I] are lucky enough to have older sisters who have been going through this for a long time, so we kinda got to watch them go through it and learn from that.” She said that of course she and Kylie go through their own issues, but they have been able to use their sisters’ lives and mistakes as a guide of what to do and what not to do in certain situations. She said one of the biggest lessons she has learned is not to take everything so seriously. This definitely seems to be paying off because we’ve seen their sisters' mistakes play out in front of millions, but for Kendall, the most drama about her seems to be which boy bander she’s dating at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-wants-a-break-from-the-spotlight>She Wants A Break From The Spotlight</h2><p>Kendall knows she’s been on the up and up for most of her life. So she recognizes when she might need to just let loose a little bit (but hopefully not too loose because she’s still the good girl Jenner that we love) and disconnect from the fame that she kind of didn’t ask for. “Every day, I have to find a way to escape; I have to go borrow someone else's car,” she said. “Sometimes it takes me an hour to figure out how to get rid of these guys who have been following me all day. And the second that I feel it getting the better of me, I have to go chill.” She added that she loves to “disconnect” from the spotlight any chance she can. There’s nothing wrong with the fame and fortune her sisters seem to love, but there’s something about not wanting it as much that makes Kendall Jenner seem like the realest Kardashian and Jenner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2nsqK%2FzqeqZq%2BYrnqssc2dmKWkXZ%2Byr7rEq2Siq12ptaZ50Z6YpZ2jqXquscybnKtln5t6tbTEZqKaqpSWwKm1wKdko52eo7KzecWapKKkqWQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./katherine-jackson-grandchildren-4573478.html>&#171;&nbsp;All About Her 26 Grandkids Hollywood Life</a>
