But as of late, things seem to have slightly gotten out of hand. After CK admitted to claims of sexual misconduct, fans have not taken too kindly to CK’s jokes, which sometimes can be too sexualized. But while CK lost almost all of his career in the process, he has come back to comedy. Throughout his struggles, CK was supported by his daughter especially his eldest daughter, Kitty Szekely. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Kitty Szekely.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wiki/Bio Facts</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=3.5><tr><td>Name</td><td>Katherine Szekely</td></tr><tr><td>Nickname</td><td>Kitty Szekely</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>not yet pursue</td></tr><tr><td>Birth year</td><td>2002</td></tr><tr><td>Birth place</td><td>USA</td></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>Female</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity</td><td>White</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>High school (name unknown)</td></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Louis C.K.</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Alix Bailey</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Mary Louise Szekely, her younger sister</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Appearances</td><td>Louis C.K.

While her father Lewis was widely recognized as a comedian, her mother was an actress and an artist. As a young kid, Katherine spent most of her time in Lowell, Massachusetts. In 2006, Katherine welcomed a younger sister Mary Louise. Following the birth of her sister, her parents decided to get divorced. While no accurate reasons were given for the pair’s divorce, Lewis hinted that it had something to do with the constant objectification of his wife during his jokes. Following the divorce, Lewis admitted to GQ that his wife deserved privacy.</p><p>“I couldn’t really talk about my wife anymore. Not that I was ever really talking about her, exactly, but now I couldn’t do that at all; I couldn’t talk about the woman I was divorced from. She deserves her privacy. But that meant I had no idea where I was going to get material. It was like, ‘Oh, shit, there goes my act.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Louis-C.K.-daughter-Kitty-Szekely.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Supporting her dad through and through:</h2><p>In the wake of the “#MeToo” movement, Lewis CK was accused of sexual misconduct by five different women including Chicago comedy duo, Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov. The duo revealed that CK took them up to his room and began masturbating in front of them. CK took ownership of his mistakes and later apologized to his fans and those he had wronged. After the accusations, CK lost almost all of his work and had to semi-retire from comedy. While most of his fans were against CK, his daughter supported him through the whole process. The pair were spotted following the accusations and were having a good time together. While his daughters eventually came around, CK revealed that it was not exactly easy to convince them. He needed help from Sarah Silverman who in her first season of the show&nbsp;I Love You, America,&nbsp;delivered a monologue saying how you can still love someone even after a history of sexual misconduct.</p><p>After the video aired, CK showed the video to his daughters to help them better understand what their father was accused of. In an interview later, Silverman revealed the phone call she had with CK following the accusations.</p><p>“I will say — and I hope this is okay to say — that after I did that [monologue], he called me. And he said it really helped one of his daughters to understand. She showed it to him and she said, I can love you even though you did bad things. And we cried. It was a small silver lining in a very bleak story.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>TV Appearance</h2><p>IN 2007, Kitty made her first appearance on TV in the documentary Louis C.K.: Shameless, where she played herself as Louis C.K.’s daughter. The documentary featured Louis C.K.’s stand-up comedy routines about his personal life, including his marriage and parenthood. In 2013, She appeared on TV again in the documentary Louis C.K.&nbsp;Oh My God , where she reprised her role as Louis C.K.’s daughter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net worth</h2><p>Kitty has not yet pursued a professional career, but has inherited some of her parents’ wealth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Relationship</h2><p>Kitty has grown up in the spotlight, but has also maintained a low profile when it comes to her personal life. She has rarely been seen with any potential romantic partners, and has not confirmed or denied any dating rumors. She has not shared any details about her current or past relationships, nor has she posted any pictures or videos of herself with anyone on social media. She seems to prefer keeping her love life private, away from the public eye and the media scrutiny.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>College Life</h2><p>Kitty Szekely is currently attending college, but the name of her college and major are not disclosed to the public.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Physical Traits</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tr><th>Trait</th><th>Value</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Height</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Eye color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Hair color</td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGiuoaddnsBuuM6uoKxlk2K4brDArp6hrJWneqy1062wZquqmrimuNhmn56qXay2rLWMm6CoZZaWsLW%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./rhoc-kelly-dodd-makes-enemies-by-defending-vicki-gunvalson-w211417.html>&#171;&nbsp;'RHOC': Kelly Dodd Makes Enemies by Defending Vicki Gunvalson</a>
