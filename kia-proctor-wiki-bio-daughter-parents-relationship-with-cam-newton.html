Before gaining attention due to her relationship with Newton, Proctor worked as a model and dancer. Over the years, she has maintained a relatively low profile, preferring to stay out of the spotlight despite her association with the renowned athlete.</p><p>Kia was originally born Shakia Proctor on 6th October 1988 in Virginia, Maryland, in the United States. The names of her parents are Jerome Proctor and Anne Maria Proctor.</p><p>The pair raised Kia and her siblings in Maryland, where she had her basic education. Shakia is an American citizen and a product of parents who come from different ethnic backgrounds, thus, she has multiple ancestries.</p><p>As regards her occupation, Proctor is a model and party host. She used to be a stripper at a well-known strip club called Washington DC Stadium Club in the States. During her dancing days around the pole, she was known as Hazel.</p><p>Not much is known about her modeling career but we do know that she has hosted numerous parties in Atlanta, Georgia. Even though Kia is easily recognized for being the girlfriend of Panthers’ Newton, she is highly respected in the showbiz industry for her professionalism both in modeling and event hosting.</p><h2><strong>&nbsp;Kia Proctor at a Glance</strong></h2><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Kia-proctor-2.jpg alt width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Is Kia Proctor Married and Does She Have Kids?</strong></h2><p>Kia Proctor has never been married or taken to the altar by any man both in the past and present. She is currently not married but she shares four beautiful children with her longtime partner, Cameron Newton.</p><p>Their first offspring, Chosen Sebastian Newton was born on 30th December 2015 in Atlanta while their second child, a daughter named Sovereign-Dior Camebella Newton was born two years later, precisely in the month of February. The couple welcomed their third child, a boy named Camidas Swain Newton, in the month of July 2018, and her fourth offspring in October 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Kia-proctor-2.jpg><p>Although Proctor has given Cam four healthy kids, she has given birth five times. Her oldest child (a girl) was fathered by a man she dated in the past.</p><p>She often shares her pictures on her social media pages but has never revealed the father of the girl or her birth details.</p><h2><strong>What We Know About Kia Proctor’s Messy Relationship With Cam Newton</strong></h2><p>As at the time of writing this piece, Kia Proctor and Cam Newton’s relationship is in a messy state: the two have reportedly separated after so many years together.</p><p>The couple met in 2013 while Kia was a dancer at the infamous Washington DC Stadium strip club. The public came to know about their relationship for the first time when they debuted as a couple at the Kentucky Derby after which they were spotted together at the NFL’s post-season awards ceremony.</p><p>Over the years, Kia Proctor and Cam have maintained a low profile on their relationship and family affair but the two are in the middle of a serious legal battle right now.</p><p>It all started after they called off their relationship for undisclosed reasons and also went ahead to delete photos of themselves on their Instagram pages. It is not known exactly when they separated but we gathered that they were not living together as at the time their last child was born.</p><p>The footballer has now filed for joint custody over his four kids and visitation. He also wants a DNA test conducted on the kids even though his signature is on their birth certificates. Kia Proctor, on her own part, is ready for paternity tests so long as Newton pays for them.</p><p>In addition to primary custody, she also wants her longtime partner to pay for child support as well as $15,000 for her to employ a forensic accountant for an examination of Cam Newton’s finances.</p><p>The couple has spent over six months in court over these issues. As gathered, Kia plans to move back to her hometown, Maryland, once she is granted primary custody of her children while Newton wants to remain in Atlanta.</p><h3><strong>All The Facts About The Emerging Scandal Surrounding Cam Newton</strong></h3><p>Cam Newton is highly-respected for his intimidating career timeline and exceptional skills in the NFL. As one of the league’s most talented quarterbacks, he is always in the public eye and so, we are not surprised that rumor about him fathering a child with another woman has been making the rounds.</p><p>News about him cheating on Kia Proctor with his side chick broke out early this year; it was reported that his side chick was pregnant during the period Kia was also carrying the footballer’s baby while they were still together.</p><p>It is not known how and where exactly Cam Newton and his side chick met. However, from their Instagram feeds, it’s clear the two were getting along well before their secret leaked. Cam, on several occasions, liked her sexy pictures on Instagram while he was still dating Proctor.</p><p>Following the shocking report, Newton is yet to admit being the father of the child or react to the rumor. His alleged second baby mama has not also opened up about the identity of the father of her child.</p><h2><strong>Who is Cam Newton’s Newly Alleged Baby Mama?</strong></h2><p>Her name is La Reina Shaw. As mentioned earlier, she is an Instagram influencer and fitness model. She was born in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, on 30th September 1986.</p><p>There is no available information about her family background, parents, siblings, education, and life before fame. However, Reina is known to many Instagram users, especially those with interest in modeling. She usually uploads her modeling photos there and also reaches out to her followers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/kia-e1580380195700.jpg><p>While it’s not clear if Shaw and her footballer beau are living together, we believe Newton’s alleged baby mama is busy taking care of her young one with much support from her boyfriend.</p><h3><strong>Is The Cam Newton’s Baby Allegation True or Mere Rumour?</strong></h3><p>Even though it’s been alleged that the footballer fathered a child with La Reina Shaw, no one knows if the allegation is true or yet another unfounded rumor about celebrities.</p><p>The rumor that Newton rented an apartment above a restaurant he owns for Shaw makes it easy to believe that he is the father of her child but his silence on the issue could mean that the allegation is not true or that he doesn’t want to be dragged into Reina’s baby’s paternity controversy.</p><h2><strong>Key Facts About Kia Proctor?</strong></h2><h3><strong>What is Kia Proctor’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Some websites estimate her net worth to be $400,000.
