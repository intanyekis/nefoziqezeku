His efforts paid off in 2014, when a court legally recognized him as the father of his son.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC2wKymp2WglsGztcJmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./josh-duhamel.html>&#171;&nbsp;Josh Duhamel</a>
