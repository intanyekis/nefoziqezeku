If you are passionate about something enough to consider it a hobby, that can sometimes be an incredibly alluring part of what makes you you. If you don’t have any hobbies or particular traits to begin with, you may find it hard to ever get past the first few dates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you are able to move past the first few dates and become exclusive, then you need to ask yourself if you are in a healthy relationship. There are a few key signs, but none may be any more clear than when you think about how you feel when you are around your partner. Do they enrich your life? Are their hobbies and interests similar to yours, or if they aren’t, are they at least interesting enough that they can help add value to your life?</p><p>Some of the traits or hobbies on this list are okay when observed in moderation. Moderation unfortunately seems to be something that a lot of people struggle with, and when these traits become dominant parts of your personality, they can cause resentment to build up in your relationship.</p><p>Your partner is supposed to be an escape from some of the most annoying parts of your life, and your relationship will not work if they’re one of the most annoying people to you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is critical to make sure that you have some hobbies and personality traits that help instill your own sense of self. If you don’t, you may find yourself lacking a concrete identity that is strong enough to support a healthy relationship.</p><p>If you further develop your social skills, you may also find it easier to receive critical feedback and be more aware when people may get tired of hearing about a certain topic. Don’t get me wrong, I totally understand why it’s important that Kim Kardashian got her haircut, I just don’t need to hear about it at 3am.</p><h2 id=10-she-gossips><strong>10. She</strong><strong> Gossips</strong></h2><p>Via Bigstock Images</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the most alarming red flags that can pop up in a relationship is when you are constantly hearing your partner gossiping. Similar to abusing social media, you need to hope that if there are issues in your relationship, your partner is not spreading the news to everyone within a certain radius. Gossip can spread and can cause more damage than the original issue entirely. Furthermore, if you find your partner constantly gossiping about other people, ask yourself if that is the type of person you want to be in a relationship with. Talking behind someone's back, which often occurs during a gossip fight, is incredibly rude and disrespectful to the person&nbsp;involved.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-she-has-no-hobbies><strong>9. She Has No Hobbies</strong></h2><p>Via Bigstock Images</p><p>There might not be anything more annoying than somebody who does not have any hobbies of their own. You need to be able to have your own passions and interests in life to help push you through tough days. If you find yourself with nothing that excites you, you may quickly find that you don’t excite your partner any longer either. There is nothing wrong with not knowing what some of your hobbies are, but it is important to always try and keep an open mind to potential new avenues in life. It’s going to get old really quickly if you never know what you want to do for a date, and also don’t have any real strong opinions about any of the options presented. I know watching Netflix is a lot of fun, but it doesn’t really count as a hobby.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-she-won-t-get-off-the-phone><strong>8. She Won’t Get Off The Phone</strong></h2><p>Via Bigstock Images</p><p>There can be something really nice about being able to talk to your partner at the end of the day. One of the most annoying traits can occur if your partner does not understand when it is simply not a good time to talk. It can be time consuming to be on the phone and you need to hope you have a partner that understands you cannot always be available to have a lengthy conversation. This can be further annoying if they call you, but have nothing of value that they wanted to talk about and it just leads to a lot of dead air on the phone. If you are out on a date with someone and they are constantly answering their phone to talk to others, you may quickly find yourself feeling neglected.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-she-s-flirtatious-with-others><strong>7. She's Flirtatious With Others</strong></h2><p>Via Bigstock Images</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sometimes you can be out and about and not realize that you are flirting with other people. It can be incredibly distressing if you constantly find your partner’s hobby is trying to woo the affection of or flirt with strangers or friends. You need to hope that your partner loves you and is committed to you, and flirting is something that can make a lot of people feel insecure with their relationship. It is also concerning if they are flirting with other people to try and get a desired result. If they do not realize they are flirting, you need to hope that you can have an open and honest conversation about why you feel that behavior is being displayed. Given that technology is prevalent in society, it is also important to note that emotional cheating and infidelity can occur not only in person, but also online.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-she-s-obsessed-with-make-up><strong>6. She's Obsessed</strong><strong>&nbsp;With Make-Up</strong></h2><p>Via Bigstock Images</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I totally understand that make-up is a huge part of some women’s lives. If you have a product out there that can instill more confidence in yourself, is there really any harm in overdoing it? Absolutely. Your objection may come from an aesthetic angle, as I personally don’t like make-up that is overdone, or other elements such as the financial cost that can go into supplying make-up. Not to mention it can be distressing if every time you and your partner go to leave the house, it involves a giant production of her getting ready. Totally cool if done in moderation, totally reasonable if you go fancy once in a while, but not my cup of tea if every day you wake up and need to spend 45 minutes getting your make-up organized.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-she-s-obsessed-with-shopping-materialism><strong>5. She's</strong><strong> Obsessed</strong><strong>&nbsp;With Shopping/Materialism</strong></h2><p>Via Bigstock Images</p><p>The thrill of shopping for long hours at a mall can quickly get erased when you look at the bill at the end of the day. One of the most annoying hobbies can be if you are with someone who constantly feels like they need to fill their life with material goods. It is one thing to buy things for fun once in a while, but it can be distressing when someone describes shopping as being one of their favorite things to do. Not to mention that being in a mall for an extended period of time can be incredibly draining and puts an additional strain on your wallet as you constantly find things that are "on sale" but still aren’t necessary purchases (but you might as well, because you’re already there, right?).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-she-s-close-minded-in-terms-of-entertainment-movies><strong>4. She's</strong><strong> Close Minded In Terms Of Entertainment/Movies</strong></h2><p>Via Bigstock Images</p><p>Now to be fair, this absolutely goes for any type of movie genre. If you only like one type of movie, you may be someone that needs to look into diversifying your interests. Lord help me though if the only type of movie that you ever want to watch is a romantic comedy. Sure, this sounds like a stereotypical thing to say, but it doesn’t make rom coms all the harder to sit through once you’ve already seen a few in the last little while. It can also lead to your partner having unrealistic expectations about what a relationship looks like if her main comparison is going to be all of the different love stories that she saw growing up (here’s staring at you, Disney). An amazing part of life is being able to explore different experiences, and you need to hope you have a partner that makes you feel adventurous.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-she-becomes-difficult-to-handle-during-her-period><strong>3. She Becomes Difficult To Handle During Her Period</strong></h2><p>Via Bigstock Images</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While I do not have the ability to have a period, I completely understand that this can be something that is really unpleasant. It hurts, it can impact your emotions and overall it's just not a very good time for many women. It can be incredibly hard to handle for everyone involved, if you turn into someone that is hard to deal with during that time of the month, every month. No period is an excuse to treat your partner like garbage, and it’s awful to hear about people who get reamed out by their partners, their excuse being “oh sorry brah, was my time of the month.”</p><p>While having your period is out of your control, how you handle it and how you treat your partner can help make the experience a lot more pleasant for the both of you. Similarly, if you’re a guy and you’re squeamish about talking about it or buying the necessary protection if the situation arises, perhaps re-check your maturity level as you go forward in your relationship. Of course they aren't going to be in the best mood all of the time, and you need to make sure that you are still putting the effort into making sure your relationship dynamic is healthy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-she-s-obsessed-with-celebrity-culture><strong>2. She's</strong><strong> Obsessed</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>With Celebrity Culture</strong></h2><p>Via Bigstock Images</p><p>It’s one thing to try and keep up with the different celebrity trends, but it’s another entirely to obsess over celebrity culture. Just because a Kardashian posted a new Instagram photo does not mean the entire world needs to stop and take note of such an occasion. It can be incredibly draining if you are constantly hearing about the latest celebrity scandal, but in reality, you don’t care even a little bit. It is also just shocking how many God awful reality TV shows there are that are centered around celebrities that you may be dragged into watching if your partner is all about that action. I’m not saying Kanye West’s latest outfit isn’t so important that it needs to interrupt my breakfast…oh wait, that’s exactly what I am saying.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-she-s-obsessed-with-social-media><strong>1. She's</strong><strong> Obsessed</strong><strong>&nbsp;With Social Media</strong></h2><p>Via Bigstock Images</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I totally understand that social media is a really cool thing. How are you supposed to live with yourself if you missed a pivotal status update about your friend’s latest day at the gym? One of the most annoying hobbies that your partner can have is that they are way too obsessed with social media. You have a problem? Air it out with your partner and don't put it out there for the entire world to see. It can be annoying if you are out on a nice date and trying to enjoy dinner, and she is constantly pulling out her phone to take different angles of her #instadessert. Similarly, make sure that your partner does not feel like they are prioritized after your phone. Remember that not everything in life needs to be a comparison, and if you spend too much time on social media you can start to really miss the amazing things going on in your everyday life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmatoJVifnF5zKiqrWWRo7uwxcinnmasopa2tb%2BMsqauql2ctrO4xaugnqaUYrCiuoyhmK%2BdXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./elizabeth-tabish.html>&#171;&nbsp;All About Elizabeth Tabish Net Worth, Bio and Height</a>
